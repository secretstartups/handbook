## A developer's guide to working with the GitLab.com database

GitLab.com is powered by a large PostgreSQL database ("the database" in this doc) which is often used as a point of reference in terms of scale - after all, this is the largest installation of GitLab we have access to.

From a development perspective, it is often necessary to gather statistics and other insights from this database - for example to provide insights for query optimization during database review or when we need more insight into data distribution to inform a product or development decision.

This overview is aimed at developers wanting to access the database and also explains how to get this type of access in the first place.

### Types of access

There are a couple ways to directly access the database for developers:

#### Direct access to data

##### Direct database access to a production replica

This is the most straight forward type of access: You'll have access to a psql console to an actual replica of the database (which typically serves live traffic). The console will be read-only and a 15s statement timeout must be adhered to.

How to get access: File an [access-request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#single-person-access-request) and ask for production database console access (role: `db-console`).

##### Access to the "archive" replica

In this case, you'll have access to a psql console to the "archive" replica. This is a replica of the database which does not serve live traffic and is prepared to be used in a rather "exploratory" fashion (suitable for rather analytical queries, too). The console access is read-only and a 15 minute statement timeout applies.

How to get access: File an [access-request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#single-person-access-request) and ask for console access to the archive database in production (role: `db-console-archive`).

##### Rails console access

A Rails console can be used to access the database, too. Use with extreme care as this is typically a read-write console.

How to get access: File an [access-request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#single-person-access-request) and ask for Rails console access in production (role: `rails-console`).

##### Use postgres.ai (currently under evaluation) to work with a thin clone of the database (includes direct psql access to the thin clone)

We currently evaluate postgres.ai which gives us the ability to work with a thin clone of the database. This has the benefit of providing a fully isolated read-write database for a single user. Thin clones are inexpensive to create and can be used and destroyed as needed.

With the extended setup, you'll be able to use a psql console on a thin clone, too. This is the most flexible way of working with the database, as this even allows you to e.g. create new tables (e.g. for intermediate results) as needed.

For details on the evaluation, please see [database-team/team-tasks#4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/database-team/team-tasks/-/issues/47).

#### Query plans and optimization

In order to evaluate query performance, we have the following tools available:

1. Retrieve query plans through [ChatOps on Slack](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/understanding_explain_plans.html#chatops)
2. Use [`#database-lab` Slack channel to work with a thin clone of the database](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/understanding_explain_plans.html#database-lab)
3. Use [postgres.ai](https://postgres.ai/) (currently under [evaluation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/database-team/team-tasks/-/issues/47)) to fully immerse into working with a thin clone to optimize queries

### Where do I get help with setting up access or any other questions?

Please reach out to `#database` on Slack and consider adding to this page afterwards.
