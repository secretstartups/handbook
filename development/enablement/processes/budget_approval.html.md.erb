## Budget and Expense Tracking

The available budget and actual expenses are tracked in a shared spreadsheet "Enablement Budget Tracking". All managers are responsible for entering expenses, and all team members can view and comment.

## Courtesy

Budget planning is done in the beginning of each fiscal year. Once the exercise starts, every team member will be acknowledged and encouraged to submit requests for the year. 

On the other hand, please expect that not all requested budget will be approved. Once budget planning is complete, the above tracking sheet will be updated to reflect the actual allocations.

Everyone is encouraged to respect budget planning and be courteous to teammates. Over spending will reduce peers' opportunity of career and professional development.
