## How We Work

The Dynamic Analysis group works according to kanban principles. While the group still follows the workflow states and activities articulated in GitLab's [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/), it operates on a 
pull-based methodology once work is handed off to the development team for delivery. An issue is considered handed off into the development team when it is given the `~workflow::planning breakdown` label, and the team utilizes the following 
labels as part of its work.

- [Official Dynamic Analysis Delivery board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5719921?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Adynamic%20analysis)

| State | Expected Outcomes |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| `~workflow::planning breakdown` | Issues are optimized for delivery based on [Issue breakdown] principles. |
| `~workflow::refinement` | Implementation plan added to the issue description. Weights are not required due to the small size of issues. |
| `~workflow::ready for development` | Buffer queue - issue deemed to be `~Deliverable`, `~Stretch`, or possibly punted to a future iteration. |
| `~workflow::in dev` | Last MR is up and out of Draft or WIP status. |
| `~workflow::in review` | Last MR is merged. |
| `~workflow::verification` | Functionally working changes are available in a production environment. Record demo where possible. |
| `~workflow::complete` | Code is verified, the work is complete, and the issue is closed. |

### Additional notes

Issues worked by this team are backend-centric and are typically in one the above repos, [vendored templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security), and GitLab's [Rails monolith](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab). At times, issues can require support from Secure's frontend team if UI changes are required. We will require more notice for initiatives like these.

## Issue breakdown

Team members are empowered to create new issues, attach them to relevant epics, and collaborate with product management to determine if they are included in current scope.

### Breakdown principles

Issues are broken down according to the [INVEST mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)).

- **Independent**, the issue should have minimal to no dependencies so it can be played in isolation of other issues.
- **Negotiable**, the issue should be structured such that the PM can prioritize or deprioritize it with minimal effect on the overall feature.
- **Valuable**, the issue should provide value when released to production.
- **Estimable**, the issue should make clear what is in scope and out of scope so that engineers can provide an estimate.
- **Small**, the issue must fit inside one milestone, ideally, design to delivery should take less than two weeks.
- **Testable**, the issue must be able to be tested. If it can't be tested, it can't be guaranteed to work in future.

### Vertically split

Issues should be split vertically rather than horizontally. Splitting vertically means the whole system will do something noticeably different; splitting horizontally results in trying to realize the fullest possible change in an individual component.

For example, imagine there is an epic to a CRUD feature to a site. Issues could be split up and played in the following order:

1. Read. This is independent, negotiable, estimable, small and testable. It is also valuable because in production an engineer could manually create the data to be read by users.
1. Create. This is independent, estimable, and small. It is testable because the Read functionality has already been built. It is valuable because engineers don't need to manually create data anymore, and it is negotiable because a PM may decide that engineers manually creating data is good enough.
1. Delete. Same as above, and it is valuable because engineers wouldn't need to manually delete records in production.
1. Update. Same as above, and it is often deprioritized by PMs because Create and Delete is often good enough.

## Repeated tasks

There are several maintenance tasks that need to be completed each milestone. Each iteration, an issue is opened and assigned to an engineer on a rotating basis. Those rotating tasks are:

- Review upstream changes, and open an issue to upgrade DAST if the upstream changes provide important improvements
- Review the [security dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/security/vulnerability_report) for DAST and address all critical and high issues. Review the dashboards for upstream projects, [ZAP](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/zaproxy) and [ZAP Extensions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/zap-extensions)

### Team Organization

Our dynamic analysis testing group works primarily as 3 sub-teams, a DAST team(Go/Python/Rails), a coverage guided team(Go/Rails) and an API Security/Fuzzing team(C#/Python).

### DAST Technologies

The DAST analyzer we build relies heavily on OWASP's [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) open source software and [ZAP Extensions](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions). This means the accuracy and quality of the DAST analyzer is impacted by the quality of the underlying OSS.

We [monitor the underlying tools](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependencies/zaproxy/-/security/dashboard) for changes and for vulnerabilities.

ZAProxy and ZAP Extensions do not have significant test coverage and therefore changes in those tools could impact DAST in unexpected ways. Since our expectation is that customers run
DAST in a CI environment and stability and security is of utmost importance, we do not necessarily ship the latest ZAP build. We actively review the ZAP changelog and evaluate whether
new updates deliver value to our customers and their use cases. We may ship a [pre-release build of ZAP or a versioned build](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/releases)
if we determine it contains valuable updates for customers and it passes our CI pipelines.

An assigned backend engineer reviews upstream updates at least monthly to identify new bug fixes or features.
Those changes are presented to the Product Manager for prioritization into DAST.

#### New DAST Technologies

The DAST analyzer is migrating towards using exclusively a browser-based DAST tool that is being built by GitLab. The tool has internally been referrred to as Browserker. Browser based DAST was released as GA in 15.7. The browser-based DAST is being delivered iteratively, with each new iteration taking over some parts of analysis previously done by ZAP, with the eventual goal of deprecating ZAP completely. 

### Fuzzing Technologies

- The API Security product is built using mostly C# with some small amounts of Python. Our engineers use Windows VMs for development.
- The coverage guided fuzzing team works primarily in Go, but is also responsible for maintaining the open source fuzzers in JSFuzz, Pythonfuzz, and Javafuzz. The team also maintains the fuzzing examples in which we aim to cover all major programming languages.

### Our Approach to Fuzzing

- Fuzzing has one of the largest adoption hurdles of all the Secure products. Coverage fuzzing requires customers to write test harnesses, compile applications with special settings and generates highly technical output.

Web API Fuzzing requires generating files that allow the Web API fuzzing tool to know what parts of the application to fuzz.

Our goals is to simplify and reduce as many of the steps that a customer needs to do to get started. We want to focus our efforts on creating samples, defaults, and intelligence that will simplify fuzzing onboarding.

### Specialized Labels

We use additional labels to categorize different areas of the application.

```
~"Category:API Security" 
~"Category:DAST" 
```

For fuzzing we use the following labels.

```
~"fuzzing::coverage"
~"fuzzing::api"
~"fuzzing::protocol"
```

When opening up issues, the following label snippet often added:

API Fuzzing Issues:

```
/label ~"Category:API Security" 
/label ~"group::dynamic analysis" 
/label ~"devops::secure" 
/label ~"backend"
/label ~"section::sec"
```

Coverage Fuzzing Issues:

```
/label ~"Category:Fuzz Testing" 
/label ~"fuzzing::coverage" 
/label ~"group::dynamic analysis" 
/label ~"devops::secure" 
/label ~"backend"
/label ~"section::sec"
```

DAST Issues

```
/label ~"Category:DAST" 
/label ~"group::dynamic analysis" 
/label ~"devops::secure" 
/label ~"backend"
/label ~"section::sec"
```

### Community Contributions

The Dynamic Analysis welcomes community contributions. Community Contributors-- please make sure to add the label "group::dynamic analysis" to any Merge Requests or Issues to ensure the Dynamic Analysis team sees your contribution.

Community contributions should get prompt feedback from one of the DAST engineers. All engineers on the DAST team are responsible for working with community contributions. If a team member does not have time to review a community contribution, please tag the Engineering Manager, so that they can assign the community contribution to another team member. 

### Dashboards 
<%= partial "handbook/engineering/metrics/partials/_cross_functional_dashboard.erb", locals: { filter_value: "Dynamic Analysis" } %>

#### Targets

For our Merge Request types, we have an initial soft target ratio of 60% features, 30% maintenance, and 10% bugs based on the [cross-functional prioritization process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#cross-functional-prioritization).  This is not a hard target and we expect to see variation in this ratio as we mature and our focus evolves.

### Support Requests

The Dynamic Analysis engineering team provides support to GitLab Support Engineers [following the process outlined in the Sec Section support project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sec-sub-department/section-sec-request-for-help/).
