#### Async Ops Sub-department Staff Meeting

The weekly Ops Staff meeting follows this async format:

1. _each Friday_ - Director of Ops:
    1. Update [agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Swf5ZdnuUSvVOqbm9jCdKM8DrNsgAcb8LgG9OMOFho/edit) with relevant topics
    1. Respond to questions or items added by team members
1. _each Tuesday_ - Reminder is posted in #doe-ops slack channel:
    1. Review agenda doc
    1. Add additional items, questions, and content

### Planning Processes

Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department:

- [General Ops Sub-department Planning Process](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/general-planning.html)

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Process

In FY22-Q2 we are establishing a process for Ops stage groups to complete RCAs for their incidents. ([Ally OKR](https://app.ally.io/objectives/1335501?time_period_id=135090))

DRIs for completing these RCAs is [tracked in this table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/11695#progress).

If you are assigned as a DRI to complete an RCA kindly follow complete these steps:

1. Review and update Timeline on the Incident issue
    1. Check if the _duration of customer impact_ can be determined from the timeline. If not update the timeline with this information at minimum:
    1. When the incident first began to impact customers (or best estimate)
    1. When the customer impact was fully mitigated (or best estimate)
    1. If this information isn't in the timeline you may find it in issue comments or the incident slack channel.
1. Review and update Current Status
    1. Check if _customer impact_ is summarized in the Current Status. If it is not update it with a brief description of the impact this incident had on customers.
1. Review Root Cause Analysis
    1. Review and complete the Root Cause Analysis section with members of the your group. This can be done in the standing weekly [Incident Review Synchronous Meeting Sessions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-review/#synchronous-review-meeting-sessions), in a team specific sync meeting, or asynchronously in the issue. Solicit input from the appropriate stable counterparts (e.g. PM, Quality, UX) in addition to Development engineers.
1. Review Corrective Actions
    1. Ensure that Corrective Actions identified through the RCA process are identified and linked to the incident issue. Look for opportunities to catch problems pre-production in development, testing, staging based on the learnings.
1. Mark the issue as reviewed and completed in the table below. We will use this information when scoring this OKR.

### Ops Promotion Process

#### Promotion Document Reviews

1. Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document.
1. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department.  This can be done early and often.
1. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document.
1. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document.
1. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions.  If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why.
1. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting.  If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why.

#### Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting

Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to:

1. Review promotion projections for each group.  Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda.  *Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter.  The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group.*
These lists should include:
    1. Team Member name
    1. Targeted promotion quarter
    1. Link to promotion doc 
    1. Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. 
1. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting.




### Ops Engineering Demos

Each month there are two demos sessions organized for both APAC and EMEA timezones. These sessions are organized as opportunities for engineers to show off the things they've been working on. These sessions are each organized via a planning issue linked in the epic below. Sessions are recorded and uploaded to YouTube as well.
