## Group Change

##### As of September 2020, the Monitor:APM group will not exist in its current form. The responsibilities of the Monitor:APM team are moving to the [Monitor:Monitor group](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/monitor/monitor/) for now.

## APM

According to Gartner "Application performance monitoring (APM) is a suite of monitoring software comprising digital experience monitoring (DEM), application discovery, tracing and diagnostics, and purpose-built artificial intelligence for IT operations".
The APM team in GitLab is responsible for building a suite of monitoring solutions focusing on Logs, Metrics and Tracing all within GitLab UI
you can read more about our monitoring visions for [Logs](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/apm/logging/), [Metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/apm/metrics/) and [Traces](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/apm/tracing/).

### Performance Indicator (formerly known as NSM)

The APM group's mission is to help our customers decrease the frequency and severity of their production issues. As such, we've defined the team's Performance Indicator (PI) to be the total number of metrics and log views. The decision to use this NSM is the following:

- [Metric views are the entry point to monitoring](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/636549/APM---CUSTOMER-USAGE-(Logs-+-Metrics)?widget=8437765&udv=989280)- The more useful our dashboards are, the more likely users are to come back and not default to some other tool to help them understand what is happening in their system.
- Log views - Logs help teams correlate an event to the system's internal logs as part of the Triage workflow. The more views we'll have, the more likely that teams are resolving their production issues using our tools.

Since the PI is a single metric, we've decided to combine those two metrics into a single one, representing the team's PI.

### Accessing PI data

## Responsibilities

{: #monitoring}

The APM group is responsible for:

- Providing the tools required to enable monitoring of GitLab.com
- Packaging these tools to enable all customers to manage their instances easily and completely
- Building integrated monitoring solutions for customers apps into GitLab, including: metrics, logging, and tracing

This team maps to the [APM Group](/handbook/product/categories/#apm-group) category.

## How to work with APM

### Adding new metrics to GitLab

The APM Group is responsible for providing the underlying libraries and tools to enable GitLab team-members to instrument their code. When adding new metrics, we need to consider a few facets: the impact on GitLab.com, customer deployments, and whether any default alerting rules should be provided.

Recommended process for adding new metrics:

1. Open an issue in the desired project outlining the new metrics desired
1. Label with the ~group::apm label, and ping @gl-monitoring for initial review
1. During implementation consider:
    1. The Prometheus [naming](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) and [instrumentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/) guidelines
    1. Impact on cardinality and performance of Prometheus
    1. Whether any alerts should be created
1. Assign to an available APM Group reviewer

## How We Work

We try to adhere to best practices from across the company in how we work. For example, our Product Manager owns the problem validation backlog and problem validation process as outlined in the [Product Development Workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) and follows the [Product Development Timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline). Engineers follow the [Engineering Workflow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/).

In addition, here are some additional details on how we work.

### Adding New Issues

When adding a new issue for the Monitor:APM group, follow these guidelines:

- Add the `group::apm` and `devops::monitor` label
- Do not add a specific milestone. New issues will be reviewed and scheduled appropriately.
- For bugs, include [priority and severity labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#priority-labels). These may be updated, but it is helpful to understand the expectation.

When creating a new issue, try to consider if this issue can be completed in a single milestone, with the collaboration of at most one frontend and/or one backend engineer and one UX team member. If your issue is larger than that, consider creating an epic or splitting your issue in smaller issues.

On a regular basis the product manager will review any new issues and schedule them for the correct milestone. This often happens during the Monitor:APM weekly meeting.

### Creating Issues for Discussion

Often we need to create an issue to start a discussion about a new idea or feature. These are issues that do not have immediate implementation work, but rather are for discussion and will, in the future, lead to new issues to implement our idea.

Here is the process we use for those types of issues:

1. Create an issue with a title like "Discussion: My Great Idea". This issue can then be assigned to specific people for comments and be assigned to a specific milestone. We do not use epics for this type of discussion because we have found it is hard to keep track of epics on our main issue boards.
1. We should continue to update the description of the issue as we find new information or refine our ideas.
1. Once the discussion around the new idea gets to a point where we want to start breaking it down into implementation details, we create an epic. We use epics at this point so we can be sure to group all the issues together and still have the discussion comments in one place that can be easily referenced. We do this in one of two ways:
    1. Promote the issue to an epic.
    1. Close the original issue, create a new epic, and then add a link from the epic to the original issue.
1. Create issues to cover the different iterations of implementation. Each issue should be small enough to be completed in a single milestone. If there are dependencies between these issues, we should be sure to include that information for planning purposes.

### Breaking Down Issues

We try to break issues into small, deliverable pieces. To do this we use the `workflow::planning breakdown` as described in the [product development flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan). This lets the team know that the issue needs to be broken down before we can start implementation. Anyone on the team can look for issues in this workflow state and break them down.

### Prioritizing Issues For a Milestone

For each milestone we create a [Planning issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/monitor/apm/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/planning-issue.md) and follow the process as described in the Ops section [monthly cadence](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/monitor/#monthly-cadence). As the list of issues is finalized, the correct `Deliverable` and `Filler` labels are applied to the issues and they are assigned to the correct milestone. We also highlight work that is being done for UX, testing, and technical writing. The [APM Next Milestone Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1593380) can be used to see what issues are planned for this upcomming milestone.

#### Filler Issues

The priority issues for any given milestone are labeled with the `Deliverable` label. In addition, we want to plan for work that can be completed once the `Deliverable` issues are complete. We label these `Filler` issues.

As an experiment starting with the 13.2 milestone, we are going to try to limit the scope of these issues to about 1-2 days worth of development work.

### Starting a Milestone

To start the next milestone, the engineering manager will apply the [`deliverable`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#release-scoping-labels) label to any issues that we have a high likelihood of completing.

The product manager will apply the `release post item` label to the top issues for the upcoming milestone that we want to highlight in the Kickoff call.

### Assigning Issues

As an engineer is available to start a new issue, he/she can self-assign the next highest priority issue. Once assigned, the engineer is responsible for keeping the workflow labels up-to-date and providing async issue updates (see below). If the issue will not be complete in the current milestone, the engineer assigned is also responsible for rescheduling the issue.

### Workflow Labels

We use standard workflow labels on issues as described in the [product development flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-2-develop--test). We use `workflow::design` when working on design for the issue, `workflow::ready for development` when the issue has enough information to start development, `workflow::In dev` as we are working on the issue, `workflow::In review` when a merge request is in review, and `workflow::verification` after the merge request has been merged and we are testing the change in staging and production.

It is the responsibility of the assigned engineer for an issue to keep the workflow label up-to-date for the issue. We use the [APM Workflow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1165027) board to visualize the issues.

### Completing Design Issues

When UX is actively working on designs for an issue, the issue is assigned `workflow::design` label. Once design is complete, we close the design issue and create an implementation issue labelled `workflow::ready for development` with the design issue linked as related.

### Assigning MRs for code review

Engineers should typically ignore the suggestion from [Dangerbot's](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/dangerbot.html) Reviewer Roulette and assign their MRs to be reviewed by a [frontend engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/?department=monitor-fe-team) or [backend engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/?department=monitor-be-team) from the Monitor stage. If the MR has domain specific knowledge to another team or a person outside of the Monitor Stage, the author should assign their MR to be reviewed by an appropriate domain expert. The MR author should use the Reviewer Roulette suggestion when assigning the MR to a maintainer.

Advantages of keeping most MR reviews inside the Monitor Stage include:

- Quicker reviews because the reviewers hopefully already have the context and don't need additional research to figure out how the MR is supposed to work.
- Knowledge sharing among the engineers in the Monitor Stage. There is a lot of overlap between the groups in the stage and this effort will help engineers maintain context and consistency.

### Weekly async issue updates

Every Friday, each engineer is expected to provide a quick async issue update by commenting on their assigned issues using the following template:

```
<!---
Please be sure to update the workflow labels of your issue to one of the following (that best describes the status)"
- ~"workflow::In dev"
- ~"workflow::In review"
- ~"workflow::verification"
- ~"workflow::blocked"
-->
### Async issue update
1. Please provide a quick summary of the current status (one sentence).
1. When do you predict this feature to be ready for maintainer review?
1. Are there any opportunities to further break the issue or merge request into smaller pieces (if applicable)?
```

We do this to encourage our team to be more async in collaboration and to allow the community and other team members to know the progress of issues that we are actively working on.

### Rescheduling Issues

Towards the end of a milestone, if we find any issues that are not going to be completed, it is the responsibility of the assigned engineer to follow this process for moving the issue to the next milestone.

1. Add a comment to the issue with what work is remaining.
1. Add the `to schedule` label
1. Add an issue weight (see below)
1. Move to the next milestone

#### Issue Weights

We only use issue weights when we have to move an issue from one milestone to the next. This is to help us understand how much remaining work we have for any issue that had to move. For example, we may schedule an issue that just needs a final review differently than an issue that has not been started. We use a simple 1 to 10 scale to estimate the remaining work:

| Weight | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1 | 10% Remaining |
| 5 | 50% Remaining |
| 10 | 100% Remaining/Not Started |

### Merge Request Rate KPI

To help us stay on track with the [Development KPIs](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/index.html), we track merge request rate and mean time to merge:

<embed width="40%" style="min-height:200px;" src="<%= signed_periscope_url({ chart: 9035725, dashboard: 694012 , embed: "v2"}) %>">
<embed width="40%" style="min-height:200px;" src="<%= signed_periscope_url({ chart: 9035723, dashboard: 694012 , embed: "v2"}) %>">
<embed width="40%" style="min-height:200px;" src="<%= signed_periscope_url({ chart: 9035724, dashboard: 694012 , embed: "v2"}) %>">

Starting in 13.2, we are experimenting with some best practices to increase our MR Rate and decrease our Mean Time to Merge metrics. Here are some of the things we are working on:

- **Smaller MRs**: Break down MRs into individual components. This includes separating frontend and backend, but could also be more fine-grained such as separating database changes, service calls, API changes, etc.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Be sure to include enough information in the description of the MR so someone who is not familiar with the work can quickly understand the intent and scope of the MR. The description could include: links to related issues and MRs, screenshots, plans for future iterations, or database query plans.
- **Self-review**: Before submitting your MR for review, do an initial review yourself as if you were reviewing someone else's MR. This can help catch issues early, and may remove some of the back-and-forth between yourself and reviewers.
- **Assigning MRs to Monitor Team First**: See [Assigning MRs](#assigning-mrs-for-code-review)

### Release Post Checklist

During each milestone, we create a [Release Post Checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/monitor/apm/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/release-post-tracking.md) issue that is used by team members to help track the progress of the team [release posts](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/). We use the checklist issue to associate release post merge requests with links to the implementation issue, links to updated documentation, and list which engineers are working on each issue. The checklist issue provides a single place to see all this information.

## Recurring Meetings

While we try to keep our process pretty light on meetings, we do hold a [Monitor APM Weekly Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9woIjy7ySV3lbIJHuoyROYPZhtO1L_w3XDhgGKzZt8/edit?usp=sharing) to triage and prioritize new issues, discuss our upcoming issues, and uncover any unknowns.

## Repos we own or use

- [Prometheus Ruby Mmap Client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/prometheus-client-mmap) - The ruby Prometheus instrumentation lib we built, which we used to instrument GitLab.
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) - Where much of the user facing code lives.
- [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) and [Charts](https://gitlab.com/charts/charts.gitlab.io) - Where the packaging related work goes on as we ship GitLab fully instrumented with a Prometheus instance.

## Celebrations

### September 2020 APM Group Farewell Celebration Party

The APM group has done an incredible job iterating and improving velocity over the past months.
Unfortunately due to business realignment, the group has been realigned.
The group is holding a Farewell Celebration Party to recognize our accomplishments and have one more team get together.

Members of the APM group can expense up to $25 in the month of September for any food items of their choice.
We will hold at least one Farewell Celebration meeting where team members can (optionally) enjoy their food
with their colleagues. Expenses must be incurred in the month of September 2020 and should be submitted through the normal expense process, with the description of "September 2020 APM Group Farewell Celebration Party"
