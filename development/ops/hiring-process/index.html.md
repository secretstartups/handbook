We are running with some limited capacity in the recruiting team and we are asking hiring managers to cover all steps in the hiring process.

## Hiring Process

The process for Ops is a mix of the current [hiring manager (HM) tasks](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/hiring-manager/) and the [talent acquisition (TA) tasks](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-overview/). 

### Step 1. Identify hiring need

[Identify hiring need](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/hiring-manager/#step-1hm-identifying-hiring-need)

1. Work with Product Manager as they are [DRI of headcount planning](/handbook/engineering/#headcount-planning), Finance, and Talent Acquisition to [include vacancy in the hiring plan](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#adding-vacancies-to-the-hiring-plan-dri-hiring-manager). You should obtain a GitLab Hiring Plan ID (GHP ID)
1. [Create or Review the Job Family](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#create-or-review-the-job-family)

### Step 2. Kickoff

1. [Create Kickoff](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-overview/#step-3-complete-kick-off-session-agree-on-priority-level--complete-a-sourcing-session) 
1.  Create a separate kickoff issue for each req you are hiring (each unique GHID).  For identical roles one kickoff issue can just be a link to another, but having a separate issue for each req is valuable for tracking purposes.
1. Include label ~section::ops to the kickoff issue so we can track in [this board](https://gitlab.com/gl-talent-acquisition/req-intake/-/boards/3516477?label_name[]=section%3A%3Aops) (confidential) and use it as the single source of thruth (SSOT)
1. [Complete Kickoff](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/hiring-manager/#step-2hm-complete-kick-off)

### Step 3. Setup job in Greenhouse
1. Work with TA to [open the vacancy in Greenhouse](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#opening-vacancies-in-greenhouse-dri-recruiter)
1. [Setup scoreboard](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/hiring-manager/#step-3hm-setup-scorecard-and-prepare-interview-team)
1. Publish job ad both **internally** and **externally**
    1. [Optional] Add additional questions to the application, such as number of years of Rails experience, or qualities relevant to your role 
1. Add your own manager as a hiring manager in the req
    1. **Job Setup** (tab) > **Hiring Team** (left nav)
    1. Click `Edit` under Hiring Managers and add your manager
         1. If your manager's name doesn't show up, it's likely that they don't have any permissions to view this role currently.
         1. Scroll down to the section **Who can see this job?** and grant your manager **Job Admin: Hiring Manager** permissions
         1. Return to the previous step, and now you can **edit the list of Hiring Managers** and add them

### Step 4. Sourcing 

The main purpose of sourcing is to **Identify and engage top talent**

1. Get a [recruiter LinkedIn account](/handbook/hiring/sourcing/#upgrading-your-linkedin-account) and setup 
1. Setup LinkedIn for sourcing, for example:
    1. Create your own templates
    1. Create projects for each of your open positions or make sure you are invited to
1. Search for candidates
    1. If you are getting support from a sourcer, follow the steps to [review inbound applications](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/hiring-manager/#step-4hm-optional-source-candidates-andor-review-inbound-applications)
1. Reach Out. Consider using the templates listed in the resources. Make sure to ask for contact details of the prospect, you will need this in the next step.
1. [Add prospects to Greenhouse](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-overview/#step-4-indentify--engage-top-talent-prospects). In the prospect's profile, click in the three dots, and click on export to ATS. 
1. After importing to Greenhouse, edit the profile (under Details tab, there is an edit button) to include the email and any other contact information. This is important because Greenhouse automatically sends an email to the candidate when is moved from prospect to candidate to fill a form which includes the CV to be uploaded there.
