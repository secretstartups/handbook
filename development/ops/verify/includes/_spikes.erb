Spikes are time-boxed investigations typically performed in agile software development. We create Spike issues when there is uncertainty on how to proceed on a feature from a technical perspective before a feature is developed.

#### Guidelines

- Spikes are typically marked as deliverable to ensure clear ownership from engineers
- Spikes are typically time-boxed to a short duration, sometimes one week, never more than one milestone.
- We should try to schedule Spikes at the beginning of an iteration so that the investigation will conclude before the planning of the following iteration.
- Limit no more than 2 Spikes per milestone per group. 
- Typically multiple team members collaborate on a spike. We want to ensure we get multiple different viewpoints as well as keep the research focused and efficient.
- Engineers should consider edge cases in spikes but should not seek to solve every intricacy of every edge case
