We track our technical debt using the following [<%= group %> Technical Debt issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/<%= board_id %>), where we track issues in the planning phase.

This board has 2 main sections:

1. Issue readiness
    - In `workflow::planning breakdown` we find issues that are currently being groomed.
    - In `workflow::ready for development` we find issues that clearly defined and a weight has been assigned.

1. Impact breakdown. We use `severity::1`, `severity::2`, `severity::3` and `severity::4` labels to classify the impact of the specific tech debt item.
   We use the list below as a guideline to grade the impact.
    - `severity::1` Blocking or Critical
      - blocking debt that prevents any further changes in the area
      - we stumble on the same complex code every single time and it causes serious slow down on development
      - the problem exists in a core part of our domain that represents a dependency for a large number of features
      - the problem is wild spread throughout several domains
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::1` bugs
    - `severity::2` High
      - blocks many changes in the area or makes them difficult to work around it
      - the problem exists in an area that changes frequently, causing it or workarounds to spread easily
      - the problem is related to an important feature (e.g multi-project pipelines)
      - the problem is very common in a specific domain and leaks into other domains too
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::2` bugs
    - `severity::3` Medium
      - the problem exists in a feature that has a supporting role in our domain
      - the problem exists in an area that does not change frequently
      - the problem is very common in a specific domain but limited to its domain boundaries
      - workarounds slow down development
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::3` bugs
    - `severity::4` Low
      - the problem is very isolated and has low or no impact to development
      - the area affected does not change frequently
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::4` bugs

Note that a multiple factors can exist at once. In that case use your judgment to either bump the impact score or lower it. For example:
- the problem exists in a feature that has a supporting role in our domain but it's related to a number of `severity::2` bugs.
  Then choose `severity::2`.
- the problem is related to an important feature but the workaround is acceptable as the code around it does not
  change frequently. Then choose `severity::3`.
