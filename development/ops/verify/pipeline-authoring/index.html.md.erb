## How We Work

### Planning

#### Async Issue Refinement

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/includes/issue_refinement.erb") %>

#### Weighting Issues

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/includes/weighting_issues.erb") %>

### Release Plans

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/includes/release_plans.erb") %>

### Workflow

We use the [Pipeline Authoring Workflow issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2019514?&milestone_title=%23started) to track what we work on in the current milestone.

Development moves through workflow states in the following order:

 1. `workflow::design` (if applicable)
 1. `workflow::planning breakdown` 
 1. `workflow::ready for development`
 1. `workflow::in dev`
 1. `workflow::blocked` (as necessary)
 1. `workflow::in review`
 1. `workflow::verification`
 1. `workflow::production`
 1. `Closed`

`workflow::planning breakdown` is driven by Product, but is a collaborative effort between Product, UX and Engineering. The steps for **planning breakdown** typically consists of:
 - Product defining or clarifying the problem statement. Product and UX will collaborate on `problem validation` as needed
 - UX providing designs (as necessary)
 - Engineering clarifying the issue description as stated, and refines and weights the issue once Product and UX have provided enough details to do so.

At any point, if an issue becomes blocked, it would be in the `workflow::blocked` status. If there is a blocking issue, it needs to be added to the issue description or linked to the issue with a 'blocked by' relationship.

`workflow::ready for development` means that an issue has been sufficiently [refined and weighted by Engineering](##how-engineering-refines-issues), upon request by Product and UX

`Closed` means that all code changes associated with the issue are fully enabled on gitlab.com. If it is being rolled out behind a feature flag, it means the feature flag is enabled for all users on gitlab.com.

#### "What do I work on next?"

Each member of the team can choose which issues to work on during a milestone by assigning the issue to themselves.  When the milestone is well underway and we find ourselves looking for work, we default to working **right to left** on the **issue board** by pulling issues in the right-most column. If there is an issue that a team member can help with on the board, they should do so instead of starting new work. This includes conducting code review on issues that the team member may not be assigned to, if they feel that they can add value and help move the issue along to completion.

Specifically, this means our work is prioritized in the following order:
 * Any verification on code that is in `workflow::verification` or `workflow::production`
 * Conducting code reviews on issues that are `workflow::in review`
 * Unblocking anyone in `workflow::blocked` or `workflow::in dev` if applicable
 * Then, lastly, picking from the top of the `workflow::ready for development` for development column

The goal of this process is to reduce the amount of work in progress (WIP) at any given time. Reducing WIP forces us to "Start less, finish more", and it also reduces cycle time. Engineers should keep in mind that the DRI for a merge request is **the author(s)**, to reflect the importance of teamwork without diluting the notion that having a [DRI is encouraged by our values](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dris-and-our-values).

#### Weekly Issue Progress Updates

In order to keep our stakeholders informed of work in progress, we provide updates to issues either by updating the issue's **health status** and/or adding an **async issue update**.

##### Issue Health Status

We use the [Issue Health Status feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/#health-status) to indicate probability that an issue will ship in the assigned milestone.
When a DRI ([directly responsible individual](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/)) picks up an issue to work on, they should add the appropriate health status.
This status is also updated by the DRI as soon as they recognize the probability has changed.

The following are definitions of the health status options:

- `No Status` – If the status is left blank, we are unsure on the likelihood of an issue shipping. This is usually only before an issue has been picked up.
- `On Track` - The issue has no current blockers, and is likely to be completed in the current milestone.
- `Needs Attention` - This signals that the DRI of the issue requires collaboration it might impact planned delivery.
- `At Risk` - The issue is **unlikely** to be completed in the current milestone and will probably miss the release due dates.

Health Statuses can also be used in conjuntion with milestone board to communicate a variety of statuses. Here are some situations and how health status 
and workflow labels can work together to communicate information on the probability of an issue shipping. They are written in the perspective of the DRI.

1. I have not picked this issue yet, but I believe it will make it => column: ready for dev + health status: on track
1. I have not picked this issue yet because it's blocked => column: blocked
1. I have not picked this issue yet, and I don't know if it will make it => column: ready for dev + health status: none
1. I am currently working on this issue, there are no blockers, but I have no idea if it will make it in the milestone => column: in dev + health status: none
1. I am currently working on this issue, there are no blockers, but I believe it will make it in the milestone => column: in dev + health status: on track
1. I am currently working on this issue, there are no blockers, but I believe it wont make it in the milestone => column: in dev + health status: at risk
1. I am currently working on this issue and I need someone to help me out => column: in dev + health status: needs attention
1. This issue is done and its being rolled out with feature flag. I believe it will make it in the milestone => column: feature flag rollout + health status: on track
1. This issue is done and its being rolled out with feature flag. I don't know it will make it in the milestone => column: feature flag rollout + health status: at risk

**Notes on health status:**

1. When an engineer picks up an issue at the start of a milestone, they might not have enough information to make a prediction on the likelihood of 
their work making a milestone. For this reason, they might decide to not assign a status until they understand more. 
1. If the health was `No status` and becomes `On Track`, the DRI could provide a comment as to why they now think it will make the milestone. This would ensure this update
is seen by interested parties of the issue.
1. If the health status changes from `On Track` to `Needs attention` or `At Risk`, we recommend that the DRI add a short comment stating the reason for the change in an [issue status update](#issue-status-updates).

##### Issue status updates

When the DRI is actively working on an issue  (workflow status is `workflow::in dev`, `workflow::in review` or `workflow::verification` in the current milestone), they will add a comment into the issue with a status update, detailing:
- the updated issue health status
- notes on what was done based on the updated issue health status (especially if not `On Track`)
- anything else the DRI feels is beneficial to reflect the progress

There are several benefits to this approach:

- Team members can better identify what they can do to help the issue move along the board
- Creates an opening for other team members to engage and collaborate if they have ideas
- Leaving a status update is a good prompt to ask questions and start a discussion
- The wider GitLab community can more easily follow along with product development
- A history of the roadblocks the issue encountered is readily available in case of retrospection
- Product and Engineering Managers are more easily able to keep informed of the progress of work

Expectations for DRIs when providing updates for work in progress:

- Status updates are provided once per week, barring special circumstances (e.g. PTO)
- Ideally updates are made at a logical part of a DRI's workflow to minimize disruption, and not necessarily at the same time/day each week
  - Generally when there is a logical time to leave an update, such as a _change in issue health status_, that is the best time to do so
  - Can be used to present some technical findings or information relevant to other stakeholders

##### Tracking Inactive Issues

As a general rule, any issues being actively worked on have one of the following workflow labels:

- `workflow::in dev`
- `workflow::in review`
- `workflow::verification`
- `workflow::production` (upon **closing** the issue)

The Health Status of these issues should be updated to:

1. `Needs Attention` - on the `1st` of the month.
1. `At Risk` - on the `8th` of the month.

EMs are responsible for manually updating the Health Status of [any inactive issues in the milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline%20authoring&milestone_title=%23upcoming&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Acanary&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Ain+dev&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Ain+review&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Aproduction&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Astaging&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Averification&page=2&scope=all&state=opened) accordingly.

#### Engineering and design implementation issues

We split up design and engineering implementation into separate issues.
This makes it easier to know the status of an active issue at a glance.
Design issues go through the first few stages of our workflow. 
Once it's ready for dev, we create a new issue for the engineering implementation.
This will be in the `planning breakdown` phase of the workflow until an implementation plan has been added and weighted.

The health status should be enough to know the general status of an issue.
If you need more information on what tasks remain, you can check the implementation plan.
Every engineering implementation issue needs an implementation plan in the description.
It is a list or a table that outlines all the steps required to complete the feature.
The engineer assigned to the issue is responsible for creating this plan and keeping it up to date.
Here is [an example of one an **implementation plan** in an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296547#implementation-breakdown).

We will start this process in %14.0 and will retro on it at the end of that milestone.

#### Other Notable Labels

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/includes/notable_labels.erb") %>

### Collaboration with UX and Engineering

To create a high-quality product that is functional and useful – Engineering, PM and Product Designer need to work closely together, combine methodologies, and often connect throughout the product development.

Product Designers play a critical role in the product development of user-facing issues. They collaborate with the Engineering and the Product Manager to design the user experience for the features. Once the design solution is proposed, agreed and validated, the Engineering [DRI](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) is assigned to implement that design and functionality during the milestone for which the issue is planned.

Product Designer, PM, and Engineering use `workflow::design` to discuss possible complexities, challenges, and uncover blockers around the proposed solution. To avoid blocking reviews later in the product development flow, the Product Designer, PM, and Engineering should work collaboratively throughout the feature design and development process to check-in often, so that the UX approval on merge requests is not required.

#### Inclusive Development

Our process of planning and development relies heavily on overcommunication rather than any approval gates or automated notification mechanisms. We adhere to the proactive mindset and responsibility of everyone involved to make sure every step in the process is as transparent as it can be.

For both planning and building this means direct, cross-functional, and other relevant stakeholders are included early into the process. This makes sure everyone is able to contribute to the best of their capabilities at the right time in the process. This can include, but is not limited to, GitLab objects, Slack, meetings, and daily standups.

Some practical examples of this are:
- When you open up or begin working on an epic, issue, or merge request consider if all stakeholders are aware of this or should be updated. If unsure, error on the side of updating rather than keeping silent.
- When making significant progress make sure this is seen by the relevant stakeholders even if you don't require immediate feedback by mentioning them rather than relying on automated email notifications. Make their involvement explicit.

Note: A good practice when only wanting to inform rather than requesting a direct action from the mentioned stakeholders is to put `FYI` directly following the @mention handle.

#### Breaking down issues for iteration

We suggest using the below steps to reach the best results in the shortest time:

* Once, through user research, we have identified a user need and have generated the big idea to meet that need, Product Designer drives the process of moving that idea into a solution prototype involving PM and Engineering Team early and often.
* We take that prototype through a user testing to validate it is solving the original problem.
* When the solution is validated with users - it is time to break the big solution down into smaller issues involving a whole team (PM, Engineers, Product Designer, QA and Technical Writer).
* Engineers, Product Designer, EM and PM are expected to work closely together to find the most technically feasible and smallest feature set to deliver value to early customers and provide feedback for future product development. Check out [iteration strategies](#iteration-strategies) for help.

We aim to design broadly for an epic or full feature at least one milestone ahead of time and then break the big solution into smaller issues to pick up in the next milestones.
Suppose working one milestone ahead to design the big solution is not possible. In that case, Engineering and Product Designer will define the first most technically feasible and smallest feature set ([MVC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#minimal-viable-change-mvc)) to satisfy early customers that will be implemented in the same milestone.

#### Reviewing Merge Requests

UX should not be seen as a "gate" for reviewing Merge Requests. To avoid blocking reviews and speed up the response time, Product Designer and the Engineering DRI should work collaboratively throughout the feature development process and check-in often, so the UX approval at the stage of reviewing merge request is not required.

Tips to avoid blocking reviews:
- Product Designers should point Engineers to the needed patterns to ensure product consistency and speed up development time. (example: Pajamas components for Frontend engineers, API documentation for Back-end engineers)
- Whenever Engineering DRI submits a Merge Request that is causing changes to UI or user experience - Engineering DRI should tag the appropriate Product Designer for visibility. However, no UX approval on Merge Requests is expected at the review stage (except when the functionality was not designed by the UX department).
- Use UX debt labels to follow up implementations that are not fully aligned with the UX specification. This should be scheduled within 30 days of the initial feature release.

#### Dealing with Community Merge Requests

For more details on how to contribute to GitLab generally, please see our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/).

#### Aligning on feature development

The Engineering DRI works with the Product Designer throughout the `workflow:in dev` phase to uncover possible problems with the solution early enough that exhibit unexpected behaviour to what was originally agreed upon. If there are changes to be added that weren't agreed upon in the initial issue - a followup issue should be made and the Engineering DRI should work with the Product Manager to schedule that issue in a following milestone. This allows us to focus on [cleanup over signoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#cleanup-over-sign-off), iterate quickly on issues with [a low level of shame](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame), and still make sure we accomplish what we've agreed upon. We should be careful not to hold off on completing these followup issues so that we don't build up a significant amount of UX debt issues.

If we find that solutions are consistently not matching the agreed upon design, we will hold a retrospective with the DRI, designer, and product manager to discuss where the gaps in communication are so that we can improve. It may be necessary to begin requiring a UX approval for merge requests on certain issues to help the Engineering DRI meet the requirements.

#### Avoiding crunch times between UX and Engineering

* Ideally, the Product Manager works ahead of time with a Product Designer to validate the problem and work on the solution. See [Validation track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track) for more details. This allows us to come up with the bigger idea ahead of time, and work further with Engineering to break it down into smaller iterations. Ideally, this should be completed before the implementation milestone starts.
* Product Designer, PM, and Engineering use the [Design phase](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-3-design) in the Validation track to talk about complexities and discuss challenges and uncover blockers. Once we are all in agreement - we can have a put a direction on the board - see [Solution Validation phase](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-4-solution-validation) for details.
* Engineers and Product Designers should stay in contact and frequently align throughout the [Build track](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) to avoid unplanned changes.

#### Iteration on UX and Engineering collaboration process

In order to develop and maintain the optimal process for collaboration between UX and Engineering, the Product Designer runs a quarterly UX Collaboration Survey to assess the quality of UX collaboration on the team and gather feedback from the engineers, engineering managers and the product manager.

The results of the first UX collaboration survey can be found in the [UX Collaboration Survey issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd-ux/-/issues/38). We are making iterative process changes based on the results of this survey and sync retrospective discussions, and will reassess the quality of our UX collaboration at the end of FY22-Q2.

### Feature channels
We use [feature channels](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/chat/#feature-channels-f_) (e.g. #f_awesome_feature) for our larger features.
These slack channels are for internal discussions on ideation, requests for general suggestions, and context. For any product related updates, the Product Manager is responsible for documenting summaries from Slack discussions directly in the issue. For any other discussions relating to the technical details, the Engineering DRI is responsible for documenting these summaries from relevant Slack discussions in the issue and/or making changes in the appropriate merge request.

Discussions about definition and implementation should still happen in merge requests or issues.  By encapsulating summaries of any discussions outside of these documents (e.g. Slack channels/threads or sync calls), we ensure we keep a single source of truth driving our decisions about an implementation.
This ensures the information persists and is visible to a wider audience.
