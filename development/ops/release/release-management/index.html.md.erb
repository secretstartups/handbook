## Vision

For an understanding of what this team is going to be working on take a look at [the product vision](/direction/release/).

## Mission

The Release:Release Management is focused on all the functionality with respect to Continuous Delivery and Release Automation.

This team maps to [Release](/handbook/product/categories/#release) devops stage.

## Release Management JTBDs

See our jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) and their corrresponding grade [here](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/release/release-management/jtbd).

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Release Team:

<!--<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Release:Release Management') %>-->
<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Frontend Engineering Manager, Release (CD)', role_regexp: /Release Management/) %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Release/, direct_manager_role: 'Backend Engineering Manager, Release:Release Management', other_manager_roles: ['Frontend Engineering Manager, Release (CD)']) %>

## Technologies

Like most GitLab backend teams, we spend a lot of time working in Rails on the main [GitLab CE app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce), but we also do a lot of work in Go which is used heavily in [GitLab Pages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages) and the [Gitlab Release CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli). Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes is also useful on our team.

## Planning and Process

We are always striving to improve and iterate on our planning process as a team. To maximize our velocity and meet our deliverables, we follow a planning process for each release. For more information about that process
visit our [planning page](./planning.html).

## How to work with us

### On Issues

Issues that contribute to the release stage of the devops toolchain have the `~"devops::release"` label.

### In Slack

The group's primary Slack channel is `#g_release-management`, and the public managers channel is `#release-managers`. We also support a number of feature channels for discussons or questions about a specific [feature area](/handbook/product/categories/#release-stage). We no longer support issue specific channels, as they are easy to lose track of and fragment the discussion. Supported feature channels are:

* Release orchestration: `f_release_orchestration`
* Release governance: `f_release_governance`
* Review apps: `f_review_apps`
* Pages: `gitlab-pages`
* Deploy freezes: `f_deploy_freezes`

### Community Contributions
We hold recurring office hours to give community members a chance to discuss any questions, issues, or merge requests. For details about
upcoming office hours, [check out the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4512) or the [playlist on GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KpH7NVc9_K70mbFemd5qFq7).

#### Handling

The Release Management engineering team will work with the Product Manager to regularly triage issues that are viable candidates for community contribution. There are a few ways that team members
can assist with contributions, primarily by:
- participating in and answering questions during the community office hours
- making sure that the merge requests have the proper labels
- making sure that reviews are happening, or suggesting reviewers
- commenting on or reviewing merge requests
- offering to pair program through Zoom if a contributor needs additional assistance

If a merge request becomes a high priority task and the contributor has become less active or stalled, consider adding an explanation comment and finishing the merge request. Always remember to give credit and
appreciation to the community contributor in order to encourage future participation.

### Team Workflow

The [Release Management Team Workflow board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2051400?&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Arelease&label_name[]=group%3A%3Arelease%20management&label_name[]=section%3A%3Aops) can be used to track features as they make their way from idea to production. This board details the various stages an issue can exist in as it is being developed. It's not necessary that an issue go through all of these stages, and it is allowed for issues to move back and forward through the workflow as they are iterated on.

#### Workflow Stages

Below is a description of each stage, its meaning, and any requirements for that stage.

* `workflow::start`
  * The entry point for workflow scoped labels. From here, Issues will either move through the validation workflow, go directly to planning and scheduling, or in certain cases, go directly to the development steps.
* `workflow::problem validation`
  * This stage aims to produce a [clear and shared understanding of the customer problem](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-2-problem-validation).
* `workflow::solution validation`
  * This output of this stage is a [clear prototype of the solution to be created](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-3-solution-validation).
* `workflow::ready for development`
  * This stage indicates the issue is ready for engineering to begin their work.
  * Issues in this stage must have a `UX Ready` label, as well as either `frontend`, `backend` or both labels to indicate which areas will need focus.
* `workflow::in dev`
  * This stage indicates that the issue is actively being worked on by one or more developers.
* `workflow::in review`
  * This stage indicates that the issue is undergoing code review by the development team and/or undergoing design review by the UX team.
* `workflow::verification`
  * This stage indicates that everything has been merged and the issue is waiting for verification after a deploy.

### Engineering Evaluation & Estimation

In order to make sure sprints are effective as possible, it is important to ensure issues are clearly defined and broken down before the start of a sprint. In order to accomplish this, engineering evaluation will take place for issues that require it (small changes and bug fixes typically won’t require this analysis). Engineers will look for assigned issues with the `workflow::planning breakdown` label that have user stories defined, as well as functional, performance, documentation, and security acceptance criteria. See [Build phase](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan) of the Product Development Workflow.

Assigned engineers will work with Product, UX and other engineers to determine the implementation plan for the feature.

Once an implementation plan has been finalized, the following steps should be taken:

* The issue description should be updated to include the details of the implementation plan along with a checklist to show the planned breakdown of merge requests.
* The issue should be moved forward in the workflow to `workflow::ready for development`.
* The weight of the issue should be updated to reflect the number of merge requests estimated as part of the implementation plan. For smaller changes and bugs, the weight should be 1.
* Those updates to the issue will signal that the issue has been properly scoped and is ready to be worked on in an upcoming milestone.

#### Merge request count as a measure of issue weight

As a byproduct of the engineering evaluation process, a rough estimate of the number of merge requests required to develop a feature will be produced. This measure can be used as a way to determine issue weights. These weights can be useful during the planning process to get a rough gauge of how many features can be worked on in a milestone, and to understand how much work the team can do in a milestone. This metric also aligns with the [throughput metric](/handbook/engineering/management/throughput/) currently measured by engineering teams.

#### Tips: When you're having hard time to estimate MR count, consider PoC step.

If you have no idea where to begin the development due to lack of knowledge on the context or
you're less confident on the current technical proposal,
it might be better to work on Proof-of-Concept MR (PoC or Prototype) at first.
This gives you more insights on the current implementation details and potential required changes.

This step removes a lot of "if"s from your assumptions. When you're making a
technical proposal, often you don't have enough time to investigate the actual
implementation details. In such case, you're assuming like "Probably, this feature works
like ..." or "Probably, this feature and that feature are connected like ...", which
leaves some probability in your development plan, and if it turned out a wrong assumption, you
may need to rethink the whole approach, even though you're at the middle of development cycle.
PoC step derisks such a turnaround by cross-checking the technical proposal with
domain/performance/security experts and UX/PM.

Here is how to work on PoC step:

- Create a new MR with a title started from "PoC:". Explain the technical proposal
  in the MR description, that you think it's the best.
- Try to implement the feature in the merge request. Frontend and bakcend engineers
  can work on the same branch.
- If it takes too long time to make the feature actually works on your local development machine,
  your technical proposal might need to be reconsidered. You can seek the other viable approaches
  by hearing from domain experts or the other developers.
- If you see technical difficulties that seems impossible to be solved in the same milestone,
  you should raise a concern that there is a blocker thus we might
  not be able to finish the feature by the due date.
- If the change size is too large (e.g. you had to modify over 1000-1500 lines without tests),
  you should raise a concern that the issue is too large to ship within one milestone,
  and you can make a suggestion that what can be done in the release and what can be done
  in the next milestone (i.e. issue split).
- In the PoC review, you should ask domain/performance/security experts or the other engineers who are familer on the context
  to review the technical approach and actual code. This is to ensure that there are no big red flags on the proposed solution.
- In the PoC review, you should ask PM and UX to review the feature's behavior.
  This is to ensure that the feature is correctly implemented and orthogonal to our problem to solve.
- You don't need to split MRs. It can be done later.
- You don't need to write neither tests nor documentation. It can be done later.
- You don't need to fix failed pipelines. You can fix the broken tests later. (Although, it might have some useful information)
- You don't need to write well-organized code. Refactoring can be done later.
- The PoC MR is not for merge, however, you can copy and paste the changes into the actual MRs, and poish later.
- Definition of done of PoC step is collecting approvals from PM, UX, domain/performance/security experts.
- Once it's done, you can estimate the number of MRs. For example, if the change size is 1000,
  you can split it to 5 MRs with 200 LoC. As you add tests in the actual development,
  the finial change size per MR would be doubled.
- Once it's done, you can close the PoC MR.

Technically, if you've done a PoC step, there is no need to ask additional reviews
in actual MRs as long as you don't change the feature behavior. You can simply
focus on general engineering review or documentation review, only.
For example, improving code quality, refactoring code, writing tests, writing documents, etc.

Here are the examples of PoC step. [Example 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/16276),
[Example 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18115)

#### Issue template for feature evaluation (dogfooding, beta-tester program)

This is an issue template for feature evaluation. It includes some
important engineering tasks to be done in general.

When you enable a feature via feature flag and expect a significant impact on
user workflow or production load, you should create an issue with the following
template to communicate better with the affected users or SRE.

### Code Review

Code reviews follow the standard process of using the [reviewer roulette](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#reviewer-roulette) to choose a reviewer and a maintainer. The roulette is optional, so if a merge request contains changes that someone outside our group may not fully understand in depth, it is encouraged that a member of the Release team be chosen for the preliminary review to focus on correctly solving the problem. The intent is to leave this choice to the discretion of the engineer but raise the idea that fellow Release team members will sometimes be best able to understand the implications of the features we are implementing. The maintainer review will then be more focused on quality and code standards.

This tactic also creates an environment to ask for early review on a WIP merge request where the solution might be better refined through collaboration and also allows us to share knowledge across the team.

### Async Status Updates

Since we are a [remote](/company/culture/all-remote/) company, we depend on asynchronous updates to communicate the status of our work. We currently use 3 methods to communicate with the team, two occur daily and one occurs weekly:

#### Async Issue Updates

Our daily updates on progress and status will be added to the issues as a comment. A daily update may be skipped if there was no change in progress. It's preferable to update the issue rather than the related merge requests,
as those do not provide a view of the overall progress.

The status comment should include what percentage complete the work is, the confidence of the person that their estimate is correct and, notes on what was done and/or if review has started. Finally, if there are multiple MRs associated with an issue, please include an entry for each.

A couple of suggestions to consider when adding your async updates:
* It may be good to include whether this is a front end or back end update if there are multiple people working on it
* Adding technical notes as you work through an issue is a great way to create an opening for others to engage and collaborate.

Examples:

```
Complete: 80%
Confidence: 90%
Notes: expecting to go into review tomorrow
Concern: ~frontend
```

```
Issue status: 20% complete, 75% confident
MR statuses:
!11111 - 80% complete, 99% confident - docs update - need to add one more section
!21212 - 10% complete, 70% confident - api update - database migrations created, working on creating the rest of the functionality next
```

#### Daily Standup

The [Geekbot](https://geekbot.io/) Daily Standup is configured to run each morning Monday through Thursday and posts to `#g_release-management` Slack channel. It has just one question:

1. ***Is there anything you could use a hand with today, or any blockers?***

    This check-in is **optional** and can be skipped if you don't need any help or don't have any blockers. Be sure to ask for help early, your team is always happy to lend a hand.

#### Weekly Status Update

The **Weekly Status Update** is configured to run at noon on Fridays on the `#g_release-management` Slack channel, and contains three questions:

1. ***What were your accomplishments this week?***

    The goal with this question is to show off the work you did, and **celebrate merge announcements** (merge parrot!). This could be a whole feature, a small part of a larger feature, an API to be used later, or even just a copy change.

2. ***What do you plan to work on next week?*** (think about what you'll be able to merge by the end of the week)

    Think about what the next most important thing is to work on, and think about what part of that you can accomplish in one week. If your priorities aren't clear, talk to your manager.

3. ***Who will you need help from to accomplish your plan for next week?*** (tag specific individuals so they know ahead of time)

    This helps to ensure that the others on the team know you'll need their help and will surface any issues earlier.

#### Taking Time Off

When going out of office (OOO), be sure to clearly communicate it with other people.

1. In [PTO by Roots](/handbook/paid-time-off/#pto-by-roots), set a role for your backup person during your PTO. If you will be out for an extended period (greater than two days),
consider assigning the team slack channel `#g_release-management` as your backup to help distribute the workload.
1. Add the [Release:RM Shared Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gitlab.com_8josslksslj9avafu2p77csbkc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago) to your PTO by Roots settings so your PTO events are visible to everyone in the team. The calendar ID is: `gitlab.com_8josslksslj9avafu2p77csbkc@group.calendar.google.com`
