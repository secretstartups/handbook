## About

The Import and Integrate group is a part of the [Manage Stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#manage-stage).
The group supports the product 
* by migrating between GitLab instances and from other providers
* with 3rd party integrations, REST APIs and GraphQL foundational code, and Webhooks.

This page covers processes and information specific to the Import and Integrate group. See also the [group direction page](/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/) and the [features we support per category](/handbook/product/categories/features/#manageimport-and-integrate-group).

## How to reach us

To get in touch with the Import and Integrate group, it's best to create an
issue in the relevant project (typically [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)) and add the
`~"group::import and integrate"` label, along with any other appropriate labels. Then,
feel free to ping the relevant Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager.

For more urgent items, feel free to use the Slack Channel (internal): [#g_manage_import_and_integrate](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_manage_import_and_integrate).

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the group:

## Metrics

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/manage/import-and-integrate/metrics.erb") %>

## Work

The Product Manager uses milestone priority labels and compiles the list of Deliverable and Stretch issues following
the [product prioritization process](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization),
with input from the team, Engineering Managers, and other stakeholders.
The iteration cycle lasts from the 18th of one month until the 17th of the next,
and is identified by the GitLab version set to be released.

### Issue Development Workflow

In general, we use the standard GitLab [engineering workflow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/).

The easiest way for Engineering Managers, Product Managers, and other stakeholders
to get a high-level overview of the status of all issues in the current milestone,
or all issues assigned to a specific person, is through the [Current milestone board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1459244?milestone_title=Upcoming&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aimport%20and%20integrate),
which has columns for each of the workflow labels.

As owners of the issues assigned to them, engineers are expected to keep the
workflow labels on their issues up to date, either by manually assigning the new
label, or by dragging the issue from one column on the board to the next.

Once an engineer starts working an issue, they mark it with the `workflow::"in
dev"` label as the starting point and continue [updating the issue throughout development](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#updating-issues-throughout-development).
The process primarily follows the guideline:

``` mermaid
graph LR

  classDef workflowLabel fill:#428BCA,color:#fff;

  A(workflow::in dev):::workflowLabel
  B(workflow::in review):::workflowLabel
  C(workflow::verification):::workflowLabel
  F(workflow::complete):::workflowLabel

  A -- Push an MR --> B
  B -- Merged --> C
  C --> D{Works on production?}
  D -- YES --> F
  F --> CLOSE
  D -- NO --> E[New MR]
  E --> A
```

If someone starts working on an issue but it has the same workflow label for a
week, the assignee has to leave a comment explaining the status of the issue.
We should write at least one comment every week that the issue is not moving.

### Issue Boards

The work for the Import and Integrate group can be tracked on the following issue boards:

### Working with Security

The group has an existing [threat model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec/threat-models/-/blob/master/gitlab-org/gitlab/GitLab%20Migration.md) to assist in identifying issues that may have security implications, but there are other considerations.

An [Application Security Review](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/appsec-reviews.html) should be requested when the issue or MR might have security implications. These include, but aren't limited to, issues or MRs which:
- falls under the threat model
- handles binary files (downloading, decompressing, extracting, moving, deleting)
- modifies or uses file manipulation services
- uses methods from Import/Export `CommandLineUtil`
