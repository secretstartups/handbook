## Vision

Support the seamless integration between GitLab and 3rd party products and services, expanding GitLab's market opportunities by empowering developers to contribute.

## Mission

The Ecosystem team is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining:

- Guiding the overall design of the GitLab API
- Expanding the GitLab API with new functionality and data availability
- Integrations between GitLab and key external products
- Documentation, instructions, and best practice guides for how to work with GitLab APIs
- Best practices for external contributors looking to develop their own integrations in the GitLab codebase
- The [GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/)
- The [Pajamas framework](https://design.gitlab.com/)

## Meetings

Whenever possible, we prefer to communicate asynchronously using issues, merge requests, and Slack. However, face-to-face meetings are useful to establish personal connection and to address items that would be more efficiently discussed synchronously such as blockers.

- Weekly Ecosystem product and engineering meeting - Wednesdays 9:30am CST/15:30 UTC
    - Select meetings will be recorded and shared on [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KpoFo2QyceT_4CNfcq7do4s).
- Iteration Office Hours - As Needed
    - When faced with a complex epic or issue, we find it useful to hold ad-hoc office hours with product and engineering team members to break up the work into smaller [iterations](/handbook/values/#iteration). This is inspired by the [CEO's Iteration Office Hours](/handbook/ceo/#iteration-office-hours). Any team member should feel free to suggest an iteration office hours. The meeting should be recorded and outcomes documented.
- Async Standups - Daily in Slack [#g_ecosystem](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CK4Q4709G)
    - We use the [Geekbot Slack plugin](https://geekbot.com/dashboard/) to prompt team members for async updates. The intention of these updates is to provide visibility and to bring up anything slowing or blocking progress. There is a weekly social question on Monday for team members to share any highlights from the weekend.
        - Prompts:
            - Highlight something you did today.
            - Anything slowing/blocking your progress?
            - Tell us about something fun or interesting you did outside of work last week/weekend. (Mondays only)

## Workflow

### Issue boards

We use the following issue boards to prioritize and track our work.

- [Ecosystem Planning Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1167634) - For scheduling and prioritization. It provides an overview of the backlog and planned issues by milestone.
- [Ecosystem Workflow Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1290820) - Tracks the progress of issues that are scheduled for the current milestone.
- [Ecosystem Team Member Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1365136) - Tracks ~group::ecosystem labeled issues by the assigned team member.
- [Ecosystem BE Team Member Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2168283?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name%5B%5D=backend&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aecosystem&milestone_title=%23started) - Tracks ~backend and ~group::ecosystem labeled issues by the assigned team member.
