## Plan:Project Management Team

The Plan:Project Management team works on 
GitLab's [Project Management category] in the [Plan stage].

For more details about the vision for this area of the product, see the
[Plan stage] page.

[Project Management category]: /handbook/product/categories/#project-management-group
[Plan stage]: /direction/plan/

## Work

You can see how we work as a stage at the [Plan stage page].

For the backend team specifically, we use the standard GitLab
[engineering workflow]. To get in touch with the Plan:Project Management
backend team, it's best to create an issue in the relevant project
(typically [GitLab CE]) and add the ~"group::project management" label, along
with any other appropriate labels. Then, feel free to ping the relevant
Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager as listed above.

For more urgent items, feel free to use [#s_plan] on Slack.

#### Refining and organizing feature work

To help drive alignment with our stable counterparts, provide visibility into progress, and breakdown our vision into a series of [MVCs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc), we collaborate with Product and UX during [`~workflow::planning breakdown`](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#description-4) to refine and organize `~type::feature` deliverables into the following structure:

- Feature (Epic) - Contains all of the necessary vertical feature slices to default the corresponding feature flag to "on". The feature epic will also serve as the location to generate a corresponding Release Post item MR. The feature epic should be scoped to the [minimal amount of functionality that still provides customer value](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc). Additional scope planned for future enhancements should be stored in follow-on epics. 
  - Spike (Issue) - If we are unable to accurately estimate the effort necessary to implement the feature, we first conduct a [spike](####Spikes)
  - UX (Issue) - For larger initiatives, UX creates a separate UX issue that serves as the SSOT for design goals, design drafts, design conversation and critique, and the chosen design direction that will be implemented. [Learn more about UX issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/plan/plan.html#ux-issue-management-weights-and-capacity-planning).
  - Vertical Feature Slice (Issue) - A subset of the feature that can be completed within a single milestone, tested, and verified within the `plan-stage` group on production. 
    - Engineering Tasks (Task - _Optional_) - One or more engineering tasks that need to be completed in order to deliver the vertical feature slice. The scope of a task should generally correlate to a single MR. 

During the `~workflow::planning breakdown` phase, all issues need to be weighted so we can efficiently and effectively collaborate with Product and UX on "right sizing" the feature epic. It's advisable that all issues are connected to a parent epic that describes the broader set of improvements we are proposing within a specific area of the product. The desired outcome is to ensure it's as small as possible, maximizes our ability to iterate, and makes it easy to track overall progress on delivery, while providing meaningful value and avoiding an undue amount of "change fatigue" for our customers.  

#### Spikes

There is a decent amount of complexity in the features that we as a team are responsible for, and we're aiming to determine where the majority of risks involved in building a feature are prior to commitments being made and development starting. We are trying out a concept of a rotation of DRIs for spikes. Spikes will be a two week time period where one engineer DRI works exclusively on breaking down an issue/epic by asking questions to determine risk and complexity, creating proof of concepts, and writing up iteration plans for implementation.

The DRI will not be expected to produce MRs during the period they are on rotation, but instead, will be expected to produce issue artifacts at the end of the period, so that a first iteration can be worked on in the following milestone (either by the DRI or other engineers).

By the end of the spike, there should be documented acceptance criteria for a first iteration, that the internal parties (spike DRI, PM, UX, and EM) have all agreed to.

#### Historical Capacity

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/plan/historical_capacity", locals: { chart_ids: [7693808] }) %>

### Collaboration between backend and frontend

#### Using the ~"backend complete" label

The ~"backend complete" label is added to issues with multiple specializations (usually backend and 
frontend) to indicate that the backend component is complete. Add this label when the backend work is 
functionally complete, merged and verified but frontend, or other, work is ongoing.

### Picking something to work on

The [Plan:Project Management Build board] always shows work in the current
release, with [workflow columns] relevant to implementation. There is an
additional column to show in-progress community contributions. Filtering it by
~backend shows issues for backend engineers to work on.

It's OK to not take the top item if you are not confident you can solve
it, but please post in [#s_plan] if that's the case, as this probably
means the issue should be better specified.

[workflow columns]: /handbook/product-development-flow/

#### High Severity Issues

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/plan/high_severity_items") %>

### Working on unscheduled issues

Everyone at GitLab has the freedom to manage their work as they see fit,
because [we measure results, not hours][results]. Part of this is the
opportunity to work on items that aren't scheduled as part of the
regular monthly release. This is mostly a reiteration of items elsewhere
in the handbook, and it is here to make those explicit:

1. We expect people to be [managers of one][efficiency], and we [use
   GitLab ourselves][collaboration]. If you see something that you think
   is important, you can [request for it to be scheduled], or you can
   [work on a proposal yourself][iteration], as long as you keep your
   other tasks in mind.
2. From time to time, there are events that GitLab team-members can participate
   in, like the [issue bash]. Anyone is welcome
   to participate in these.
3. If you feel like you want to have some specific time set aside, but
   aren't interested in the topics of an existing event, feel free to
   label issues with "For Scheduling" and copy your manager for visibility.

When you pick something to work on, please:

1. Follow the standard workflow and assign it to yourself.
2. Share it in [#s_plan] - if not even more widely (like in #development
   or #backend).
