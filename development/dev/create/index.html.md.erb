## Mission

#### What do we do?

The Create Stage supports software development teams accelerate their delivery and reduce cycle times, by improving efficiency and collaboration. Our stage provides tools that support the beginning of the DevOps Life Cycle.

#### Whom do we serve?

We build tools for:

- Software Developers
- DevOps Engineers
- Development Team leads
- Product Managers
- Product Designers

#### How do we serve them?

The [Product Vision Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#categories-in-create) provides specific examples for how we serve each type of GitLab user.

## Vision

The following areas have been defined as our direction for the year:

- [Fast, reliable, and easily managed Git storage](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#fast-reliable-and-easily-managed-git-storage)
- [Binary file workflows](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#binary-file-workflows)
- [Delightful code review](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#delightful-code-review)
- [Better collaboration in OSS and within large organizations across many teams](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#better-collaboration-in-oss-and-within-large-organizations-across-many-teams)
- [Unifying our editing experiences](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#unifying-our-editing-experiences)
- [Better integrations](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#better-integrations)

## Professional Development

Each team member is encouraged to take positive steps towards **improving their skills and knowledge**.

**Growing your skillset** will lead to more insightful contributions to the GitLab Product. As your expertise grows, your impact on the product and the company also grows. Here at GitLab, it is important to us to invest in the Professional Development of our team members.
