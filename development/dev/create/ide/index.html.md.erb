## Overview

The team is part of [Create Stage][hb-create] in the [Dev Sub-department][hb-dev]. We focus on multiple [categories][hb-categories]: `Remote Development`, `Web IDE`, and the `GitLab VS Code Extension`.

### 👌 Team OKRs

If you're interested in the team's Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), you can find them on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=title_asc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aide&first_page_size=20).

### ☎️ How to reach us

Depending on the context here are the most appropriate ways to reach out to the IDE Group:

- Slack Channel: [`#g_create_ide`][slack]
- Slack Groups: `@create-ide-team` (entire team) and `@create-ide-engs` (just engineers)

### 📆 Team Meetings

**❗️Important**: For every meeting, the [IDE team's meeting document][gdoc] should be used, and filled with the meeting notes, as well as references to any other sync meeting agendas/notes/recordings which have recently occurred. This will make it easier for people to find any meeting notes.

These are regular meetings in which most team members will participate. Below is our schedule:

#### Quarterly Strategy and OKR Planning Meeting

- **When:** Once every quarter.
- **What:** In this meeting, we will discuss and align our team's strategic goals and objectives. We'll go over our progress on OKRs and define the next steps to achieve them.

#### Think Big Sessions / Optional Sync Call

- **When:** Once a month, on the week when there is no Quarterly Strategy Meeting.
- **What:** We can use this time for "Think Big" sessions or other optional synchronous calls.

#### Open Office Hours Meeting

- **When:** Every other week, alternating between APAC and AMER friendly times.
- **What:** This meeting is an open agenda, and if there are no topics, we will cancel the meeting. It's a chance to drop by and have an informal chat with colleagues. The meeting will alternate between APAC and AMER friendly times to cover different regions.

#### Retro Meeting

- **When:** Every fourth Thursday of the month.
- **What:** In this monthly meeting, we'll go over the feedback from our asynchronous team retro and identify action items and next steps. Our goal is to improve team efficiency by learning from our past mistakes and successes.

#### Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting

**NOTE: This meeting is specific to the Remote Development category planning - see [Remote Development Planning Process](#-remote-development-planning-process)**

- **When:** Every Wednesday, alternating between APAC and EMEA time zones.
- **What:** The goal of the Pre-IPM meeting is for the team leaders to collaborate on preparing all issues which are to be prioritized for the upcoming iteration(s), so they are ready for the wider team to discuss and estimate in the next IPM. For more information, see ["Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting"](#-pre-iteration-planning-meeting).

#### Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM)

**NOTE: This meeting is specific to the Remote Development category planning - see [Remote Development Planning Process](#-remote-development-planning-process)**

- **When:** Every Wednesday, alternating between APAC and EMEA time zones.
- **What:** In this weekly meeting, we will review the team's backlog and the current iteration status. We'll estimate and prioritize work for the next one or two iterations. The meeting will alternate between APAC and EMEA time zones to accommodate different regions. For more information, see ["Iteration Planning Meeting"](#-iteration-planning-meeting).

## 📦 Team Processes

### 🖖 Weekly EM Updates

Each week the team EM provides a Weekly Status update issue which aims to capture the most important items for the team to be aware of. These can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/ide/-/issues/?sort=title_asc&state=all&label_name%5B%5D=Weekly%20Team%20Announcements&first_page_size=20).

### 📄 Milestone Planning

Every month, we create a Milestone Planning issue that serves as the single source of truth (SSoT) for the current milestone.

This issue provides us with a centralized location to discuss our upcoming milestone work, plan for feature, bug, and maintenance tasks, and provides us with the necessary flexibility to iterate mid-milestone if required.

Populate the milestone planning issue with issues from the prioritized boards placed in the ~"workflow::ready for development" column. Feel free to add maintenance issues that aren’t directly related to the group as well.

Move the issues assigned to the current milestone to the ~"workflow:: in dev" column. Also, assign the ~"Deliverable" label and assign the target milestone.

You can find all milestone planning issues in the [IDE team’s project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/ide/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=all&label_name%5B%5D=Planning%20Issue&first_page_size=40).

The layout for these Milestone issues are automated and can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/ide/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/planning_issue.md).

### 😷 Issue Workflow Hygiene

In the Create:IDE team we leverage an automatic issue hygiene system via the [triage bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/tree/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide). This helps to ensure issues and label hygiene are respected, currently, our rules are:

### 🌉 Architecture Plans vs. Iteration Plans

We use the terms _Architecture Plan_ and _Iteration Plan_ when we think of outcomes to broad high-level issues. An investigative spike should result in an Architecture Plan and an Iteration Plan.

- **Architecture Plan**: A high-level vision of a technical approach that is shown to solve user problems. This plan includes a formulation of specific [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) that are important for this use cases (such as performance, usability, or security). It also includes an outline of technical approaches that will satisfy these quality attributes in addition to the functional requirement. A [spike effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)) should be created to verify and explore the technical approach for an architecture plan. The spike could result in new architectural concerns, resulting in an iteration of the plan.
- **Iteration Plan**: A plan for how we'll iteratively implement an Architecture Plan or another objective. This can be composed of low-level technical steps, or medium-level slices of use cases. The iteration plan should result in a set of issues (and possible epics) with clearly defined scope and weights.

**Sometimes it takes a time to develop a well fleshed-out iteration plan. In these cases, a "Formulate Iteration Plan" weighted issue can be used.**

### 📝 Issue Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all issues we use for planning and scheduling work within our group. Our Engineers can define specific implementation issues when needed, but the overall goal for our issues are as follows:

- Treat the wider community as the primary audience ([see relevant summary for rationale][community-contributions-wider-community]).
- Provide a meaningful **title** that describes a deliverable result.
    - ✅ `Add a cancel button to the edit workspace form page`
    - ✅ `Automatically save Devfile changes after 2 seconds of inactivity`
    - ❌ `Make WebIDE better`
- Provide a meaningful description that clearly explains the goal of the issue, and provide some technical details if necessary.
- Should there be critical implementation steps or other useful ways to create small tasks as part of the issue, please use a checklist as part of the issue descriptions.
- The issue should have a weight assigned.

It's okay to create specific engineering-driven implementation issues for more complex features. These would be called **Child Issues** and they should always link back to their parent. If one issue would spawn many child issues, consider creating an Epic.

### 🤖 Category-Specific Planning Processes

Currently, our team has two primary planning processes: one for Remote Development category, and another for the Web IDE and GitLab VS Code Extension categories.

The Remote Development team has decided to use an alternate process for the following reasons:

1. Remote Development is a large, greenfield category, with many engineering, infrastructure, and technical concerns and unknowns which will continue to evolve and change as the category matures.
1. The Remote Development category is also currently receiving much attention as part of of GitLab's competitive strategy, and thus has greater internal and external expectations for accurate estimates of feature delivery and timelines.
1. In order to meet this need for more accurate and realistic planning and delivery estimates, the Remote Development category team has decided to modify parts of the [Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan) and [Build & Test](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-2-develop--test) phases of the GitLab Product Development Flow to a more lightweight velocity-based estimation and planning process inspired by the widely-used and popular [XP](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) and [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/agile-metrics-velocity) methodologies. The goal is to provide accurate delivery estimates based on ["Yesterday's Weather"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/uploads/283f165896e2851bdc324f790d9c90e4/Screen_Shot_2023-03-27_at_6.16.51_PM.png) historical velocity analysis.
1. To better support the use of these methodologies,the Remote Development team has committed to dogfooding the [Iterations feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/index.html), and following the [documented process for running agile iterations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/agile_sprint.html) where possible.
1. However, due to existing limitations of the Iterations and Boards features in fully supporting these methodologies, we will also experiment with new and alternate tools and processes, with the goal of informing and potentially contributing back to improve GitLab's support for them. More details will be shared as this effort evolves.

The Web IDE and GitLab VS Code Extension are significantly different features, and do not share many of these same concerns or desires, therefore they will still use a workflow closer to the standard [GitLab Product Development Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow). See [this comment thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/118896#note_1330391062) for more context and discussion around this decision.

See the sections below for details on each category's specific planning processes.

## 🤖 Web IDE and GitLab VS Code Extension Planning Process

The Web IDE and GitLab VS Code Extension still use the default milestone planning process which is loosely based in the [Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan) and
[Develop & Test](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-2-develop--test) phases
of the product development workflow. We recommend reading these references for a better understanding of this workflow.

These categories have prioritized boards that are populated during
[Milestone Planning](#-milestone-planning):

- [Web IDE Prioritized Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5288010?milestone_title=Upcoming&label_name[]=Category%3AWeb%20IDE&label_name[]=Deliverable)
- [VS Code Prioritized Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5501205?milestone_title=Upcoming&label_name[]=Deliverable&label_name[]=VS%20Code)

Each column on the board represents a phase of the development workflow:

- The open lane is populated with issues labeled with the `~Category:[Category]` and `~Deliverable` labels. These labels signal that the issue is deemed a priority by the team.
- `workflow::ready for development` contains issues that are ready to pick in an upcoming milestone.
- `workflow::refinement` contains issues that require more investigation or to break them down into smaller units of work that can be delivered in a single milestone.
- `workflow::in dev` contains ongoing work.
- `workflow::complete` contains completed work.

The following diagram visualizes the milestone planning and delivery process:

```mermaid

## 🤖 Remote Development Planning Process

### Remote Development Planning Process Overview

For the reasons [described above](#-category-specific-planning-processes), the Remote Development category team has decided to modify parts of the [Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan) and [Build & Test](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-2-develop--test) phases of the GitLab Product Development Flow to a more lightweight velocity-based estimation and planning process inspired by the widely-used and popular [XP](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) and [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/agile-metrics-velocity) methodologies.

The crux of these changes is focused around the following process phases:

1. "High Level Validation and Planning". This is analogous to the [Validation Track in the GitLab Product Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track), because it needs to achieve the same [Validation Goals & Outcomes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-goals--outcomes) before we can start refining and prioritizing issues.
1. The "Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting", or "Pre-IPM". This is analogous to ["backlog refinement"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#outcomes-and-activities-4) in the standard GitLab product development flow. The goal of the Pre-IPM is to ensure that all issues which are to be prioritized in the upcoming iteration(s) are ready for the wider team to briefly discuss and estimate in the next IPM. See more details in the [Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting](#-pre-iteration-planning-meeting) section.
1. The "Iteration Planning Meeting", or "IPM". This is analogous to the ["Weekly Cycle" in XP](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) or ["Sprint Planning" in Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning). See more details in the [Iteration Planning Meeting](#-iteration-planning-meeting) section.

These components allow us to provide realistic velocity-based estimates based on ["Yesterday's Weather"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/uploads/283f165896e2851bdc324f790d9c90e4/Screen_Shot_2023-03-27_at_6.16.51_PM.png) historical velocity analysis.

**IMPORTANT: note that these process changes do not represent a full adoption of XP or Scrum methodologies. Instead, they are a minimal and lightweight process "inspired" by XP and Scrum. The primary goal is to allow the team to provide realistic planning and delivery estimates to leadership based on accurate velocity measurements. The Pre-IPM and IPM processes are the minimal components which allow us to meet that goal.**

### GitLab Velocity Board Chrome Extension

To facilitate this process, especially around calculating emergent iterations based on velocity, we will use the
[GitLab Velocity Board Chrome Extension](https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab/gl-velocity-board-extension).

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcHpLhs7Fl0) for an overview of the extension, and also for an explanation of
this general process, and why we need to use an extension to support it rather than the current  standard GitLab Iteration and Board features.

This extension is in support of a [GitLab OKR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/2085) for Create. 
We plan to continue iterating in this area, with the goal of eventually having GitLab directly support this workflow.

```

#### 1. High Level Validation and Planning

**Process:**

**TL;DR: Assign the [`Next 1-3 releases` milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48#tab-issues) milestone to all issues that should be refined and prioritized in the next Pre-IPM meeting(s).**

1. When we do high-level long-term initial planning such as this, all higher-priority issues, which should be [contained in the category epic or one of its sub-epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7419), will be assigned to the **[`Next 1-3 releases` milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48#tab-issues)**.
1. All higher-priority issues we create in the future should also be assigned to the `Next 1-3 releases` milestone.

**Explanation:**

This process identifies and validates higher-priority issues to be worked on in the upcoming releases. It is analogous to the [Validation Track in the GitLab Product Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track), and should consist of many of the same steps and processes.

In addition to validating features, this process can also result in Engineering identifying high-priority issue which are necessary to [address Technical Debt or "Friction"](https://www.mechanical-orchard.com/post/friction-over-debt?utm_campaign=Boost_friction_debt).

Issues which are not a priority to finish within the `%"Next 1-3 releases"` may have the `%"Next 4-7 releases"` or `%"Next 7-13 releases"` release applied, or alternately, they can be assigned to `%Backlog`, `Awaiting Further Demand`, or left without a release applied.

There may be concerns about over-committing too many issues to the `%"Next 1-3 releases"` release. However:

1. If we are being healthy and diligent about following the Pre-IPM process **_every week_** as defined, we should be reviewing **_ALL_** issues which have the `%"Next 1-3 releases"` during every Pre-IPM, and moving them to `~"rd-workflow::prioritized"` .
1. If we don't get to them one week, we should decide how to deal with it - either agree to do them async in the next week, schedule an extra Pre-IPM, or commit to ensuring we finish reviewing them in next week's Pre-IPM.
1. Then, during the weekly IPM, per the process defined above, these issues will be weighted and prioritized, and have their release changed from `%"Next 1-3 releases"` to a specific release, depending on what iteration they fall into (and we can always give ourselves a "buffer" by assuming, for our purposes, that only things slated to be completed by a certain time will be likely to be in the release, e.g., everything slated to be completed in the 2nd iteration of the month, which is a ~1+ week buffer before the actual release is cut).

See the [following discussion thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/13151#note_1417052962) for more context.

#### 2. Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting

**TL;DR:** 

- **Async phase - Refinement: Divide up the work to refine each `rd-workflow::unprioritized` issue which has the `%"Next 1-3 releases"` milestone using the [Remote Development issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Remote%20Development%20Group%20-%20issue.md), then apply the `refined` label.**
- **Sync phase - Prioritization: Product and Engineering leaders meet to prioritize each `refined` issue into the `rd-workflow::prioritized` label.**

##### Async Phase of Pre-IPM Process - Refinement

1. Identify all issues which:
   1. Have the `~"Category:Remote Development"` **AND**
   1. Have the `~"rd-workflow::unprioritized"` **AND**
   1. Have the `%"Next 1-3 releases"` milestone applied (optionally include additional milestones for next `3-4`/`4-7` releases, if these are being used) **AND**
   1. Do **NOT** yet have the `~refined` label
1. This can be done either by:
    1. Doing a [direct issue search](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3ARemote%20Development&label_name%5B%5D=rd-workflow%3A%3Aunprioritized&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=refined&milestone_title=Next%201-3%20releases&milestone_title=Next%203-4%20releases&milestone_title=Next%204-7%20releases&first_page_size=100)
    1. Using the Iteration Planning board by _temporarily_ applying `Label=~refined` and `Milestone=%"Next 1-3 releases"` to the board filters. _Make sure you don't save this filter to the defualt board settings_
1. Assign each of these issues to an appropriate team member to be refined. This process can be whatever works for the team, but
   in general issues should be refined by someone who has the knowledge and availability to refine them properly and promptly.
   If there are questions, ask for help or reassign it to someone else.
1. The assignee should use the [Remote Development issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Remote%20Development%20Group%20-%20issue.md) to refine the issue. The refinement should ensure
   that the description of each prioritized issue is complete, and contains enough information for the team to review, understand
   and estimate it during the next IPM, in less than 5-10 minutes, without extensive debate/discussion. 
1. If the refinement uncovers additional scope/complexity, the issue should be broken down into smaller issues, which
   are then refined individually. Optionally, an epic may be created to organize the work across multiple issues.

##### Sync Phase of Pre-IPM Process - Prioritization

1. During each Pre-IPM meeting, we will _temporarily_ [filter the Iteration Planning board on the `~refined` label](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5283620?label_name[]=Category%3ARemote%20Development&label_name[]=refined),
   so that only refined issues appear in the `~"rd-workflow::unprioritized"` list. _Make sure you don't save this filter to the defualt board settings_
1. The goal of each Pre-IPM sync meeting will be to prioritize all of these issues into the `~"rd-workflow::prioritized"` list, based on their
   relative importance, whether they are blocking other issues, etc. They are prioritized by dragging them into the appropriate order in the `~"rd-workflow::prioritized"` list, with the highest-priority issues being at the top, and the lowest-priority issues being at the bottom.
1. After an issue has been moved to the `~"rd-workflow::prioritized"` list, it should be assigned to the current `Iteration` of the `Iteration Cadence`. 
   We will eventually create an automation for this, but for now it must be done manually. The easiest way to do this is to search for `RD` in the `Iteration` field,
   and pick the top-most iteration. Then, the `Iteration Cadence` feature functionality will handle automatically rolling over any incomplete issues to the next
   iteration once the current iteration ends. Note that this only applies to `Done` iterations - for future iterations, we use the chrome extension to 
   automatically split the actual current iteration in the database into multiple future "virtual" iterations based on velocity.

**Explanation:**

The "Pre-Iteration Planning" (Pre-IPM) meeting prepares for the Iteration Planning Meeting. It is analogous to ["backlog refinement"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#outcomes-and-activities-4) in the standard GitLab product development flow.

During the Pre-IPM, the team will collaborate on creating/refining, organizing, and clarifying all issues which are to be prioritized for the upcoming iteration(s). This will normally involve Product and Engineering leaders on the team, but may also involve Design or other team members depending on the nature of the issues involved. The goal is to ensure that all issues which have been identified as a priority for the upcoming releases are properly refined, curated, prioritized, and ready for the wider team to briefly discuss and estimate in the next IPM.

If a single piece of work spans multiple projects/repos, there should be be a separate issue created for each MR in each repo. We cannot use the [tasks feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html#set-task-weight), because boards cannot display individual
tasks.

**QUESTION: Why isn't there a `~rd-workflow::refined` phase instead of using the `~refined` label?**

For a few reasons:

1. We want to keep the main process and board simple and easy to understand. The three columns for `unprioritized`, `prioritized`, and `done` phases
   are intuitive and self-explanatory. Also, the movement between `unprioritized` and `prioritized` is a sync process, which ensures the team leadership
   are all on the same page about current priorities.
1. The refinement and prioritization process may vary among different teams that use this process in the future. Keeping the three core phases simple
   means that the basic process and board approach can still be used with simpler or more complex refinement/prioritization processes.
1. Finally (and most importantly from a pragmatic perspective), the implementation of the logic for velocity and iteration calculations on the board is
   much simpler if we enforce a standardized three-phase/three-column process and UI.

#### 3. Iteration Planning Meeting

**Process:**

**TL;DR: Discuss and estimate each prioritized issue.**

1. In each the IPM meeting, all newly prioritized issues in the `~"rd-workflow::prioritized"` lane of the [Iteration Planning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5283620?label_name[]=Category%3ARemote%20Development) board are reviewed by the team. The board should be unfiltered other than the standard `~"Category:Remote Development"` label.
1. For each newly-prioritized issue, the facilitator reads the description, and the team **_briefly_** discusses the issue. If there are no blocking concerns/risks raised, the team collectively estimates the issue with rock-paper-scissors fibonacci scale, and the collectively agreed weight is assigned.
    1. If the discussion for a single issue goes on longer than 5-10 minutes or turns into an extended debate/discussion, this is an indicator that the issue has not been adequately refined, and should go back to the ~"rd-workflow::unprioritized" list, and potentially have another issue immediately created and prioritized to do further investigation/refinement, if the refinement scope may be significant.
1. Issues which are prioritized in the upcoming 1-2 iterations should be assigned to individual(s) at this point, to ensure it gets worked on and not lost.

**Explanation:**

The "Iteration Planning Meeting", or "IPM" meeting is a weekly process where a team reviews the backlog and the current iteration status, estimates and prioritizes work for the next iteration, and uses issues as the single source of truth for discussions and progress. It is analogous to the ["Weekly Cycle" in XP](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) or ["Sprint Planning" in Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning).

The goal of the IPM is to ensure all issues for the upcoming iteration have been discussed, and [estimated with weights as a team](#-what-weights-to-use). Then, each issue will be worked on, and if there are commits to be made as part of the work, there should be a 1-to-1 relationship between the issue and MR.

The iteration cycle is one week long, and the team maintains one board for tracking their progress - [the Iteration Planning board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5283620?label_name[]=Deliverable&label_name[]=Category%3ARemote%20Development).

#### 4. Assigning prioritized issues to specific releases based on calculated iterations

TODO: This can be automated in the future by adding functionality to the chrome extension. For now, it will be a manual process.

**TL;DR: Assign issues to specific releases based on their calculated iteration**

At this point, once all prioritized issues have been estimated, with the use of the [GitLab Velocity Board Extension](https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab/gl-velocity-board-extension) we will be able to know how they break down into future iterations.

Then, based on the dates of calculated iterations, we can reassign the issues from the `Next 1-3 releases` milestone into specific milestones.

### Example Lifecycle for a Feature Issue

1. Product and Design work together to identify a new feature requirement.
1. An issue is created using the [Remote Development issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Remote%20Development%20Group%20-%20issue.md). The correct labels are automatically applied by the template,
   so the issue shows up in the `~"rd-workflow::unprioritized` list of the Iteration Planning board.
   Note that the issue description may be incomplete/unrefined and high-level at this point.
1. Product decides the issue is a high priority, so they apply the `%"Next 1-3 Releases"` milestone to signal this.
1. As part of the async Pre-IPM process, someone is assigned to refine the issue, by finishing filling out the issue template, then applying the `~refined` label
1. As part of the sync Pre-IPM meeting, product and engineering leadership move the refined issue to the `~rd-workflow::prioritized` list,
   in the appropriate position based on its priority relative to other issues.
1. In the sync IPM meeting, the wider team discusses and estimates the issue, and it is assigned to whoever will do the work.
1. Once the priority and weight are determined, the current velocity will tell us what iteration the issue should be completed in, and a specific
   release milestone can be assigned to the issue based on that.
1. The assignee opens an MR for the issue, ensures that the issue and MR are cross-referenced on the first lines of their descriptions, and
   begins work on the MR.
1. When the work is completely done - i.e., the MR is reviewed and merged, the feature is verified and tested in production, etc.,
   then the issue is closed, and moved to the `~rd-workflow::done` list.

### 1-to-1 Relationship of Issues to MRs

We want to enforce that:

1. Every MRs is only associated with a single issue
1. No issue can have more than 1 MR associated with it

This is in order to facilitate accurate and granular velocity calculations and issue prioritization under this process.
The merge request is the atomic unit of deliverable work in most cases, so it must be represented in the prioritization
and calculations by being associated with one and only one issue.

If boards and epics allowed MRs to be added and estimated as well as issues, this would not be necessary - for feature/maintenance
involving an MR, we could have the MR directly represent the full lifecycle of the discussion and implementation, and not
have an issue at all.

We also cannot rely on the Crosslinking Issues feature (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/crosslinking_issues.html),
because this shows ALL linked MRs that have mentioned the issue anywhere, and cannot enforce this 1-1 relationship.

In order to enforce this via triage-ops automations
(https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/ide/#automations-for-remote-development-workflow),
the first line of the issue should have the format: `MR: <...>`:

1. For new issues, the first description line should be: `MR: Pending`
1. Once an MR is created for the issue and work is started, the first description line of the issue should be: `MR: <MR link with trailing +>`,
   and the first description line of the MR should be `Issue: <Issue link with trailing +>` 
1. If there is _NO MR_ associated with this issue, the first line should be: `MR: No MR`.
   However, this should be rare, because most issues should have some sort of committed deliverable, even if it is only
   a documentation addition or update. If it is an issue which represents a larger piece of work split across smaller issues,
   then it should be promoted to an epic.

### 📝 Ad-Hoc Work

It is normal that team members may identify issues that need to be resolved promptly prior to the next planning cycle. This may be because they are blocking other prioritized issues, or just because a team member wishes to tackle an outstanding bug or small piece of technical debt.

In these situations, it is acceptable for a team member to take the initiative to create an issue, assign proper labels, estimate it, assign it to the current iteration, and work on it, _as long as it does not adversely impact the delivery of other prioritized issues_. However, if it becomes large or risks impacting other issues which were collectively prioritized as part of an IPM, then the issue should be brought up for discussion with the wider team in the next pre-IPM and/or IPM.

### 🏋 What Weights to Use

To assign weights to issues effectively, it's important to remember that issue weight should not be tied to time. Instead, it should be a purely abstract measure of the issue's significance. To accomplish this, the our team uses the Fibonacci sequence starting from weight 0:

- **Weight 0:** Reserved for the smallest and easiest issues, such as typos or minor formatting changes, or very minor code changes with no tests required.
- **Weight 1:** For simple issues with little or no uncertainty, risk or complexity. These issues may have labels like "good for new contributors" or "Hackathon - Candidate". For example:
    - Changing copy text which may be simple but take some time.
    - Making CSS or UI adjustments.
    - Minor code changes to one or two files, which require tests to be written or updated.
- **Weight 2:** For more involved issues which are still straightforward without much risk or complexity, but may involve touching multiple areas of the code, and updating multiple tests.
- **Weight 3:** For larger issues which may have some unforeseen complexity or risk, or require more extensive changes, but is still not large enough to warrant  [breaking down into smaller separate issues](#-breaking-down-large-issues).
- **Weight 5:** Normally, this weight should be avoided, and indicate that the issue ideally [should be broken down into smaller separate issues](#-breaking-down-large-issues). However, in some cases a issue with a weight of 5 might still be prioritized. For example, if there is a large amount of manual updates to be made which will require a large amount of effort, but doesn't necessarily involve significant risk or uncertainty.
- **Weight 8/13+:** Weights above 5 are used to clearly indicate work that is not yet ready to be assigned for implementation, and _must_ be broken down because it is too large in scope to start implementing, and/or still has too many unknowns/risks. This weight is temporarily assigned to "placeholder" issues to capture the scope of the effort in our velocity-based capacity planning calculations. For more information, see ["Breaking Down Large Issues"](#-breaking-down-large-issues).

### 📝 Breaking Down Large Issues

Some issues are large in scope to start implementing, and/or still has too many unknowns/risks. In this case, we should break it down into smaller issues which can be implemented in a single iteration. These smaller issues should ideally have a weight of 3 or less, but never more than 5. Here's our process:

1. Create an investigation issue to identify the work that needs to be done. This issue represents the work needed to research, investigate, discover and document the effort, and break the work down into new issues which are small and clear enough to be prioritized and started. The investigation issue should have a weight assigned which reflects the effort required perform this investigation and breakdown. Here's an example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408186.
2. While the investigation issue work is ongoing, we create a temporary "placeholder" issue on our Iteration Board. This placeholder issue serves to capture the scope of the effort in our velocity-based capacity planning calculations while the investigation to break is down is still ongoing.
    1. It should have a weight of either 8/13+ (indicating that it is too large to be prioritized and started, and must be broken down.
    1. The title format for the placeholder issue is `[Category] - Iteration Planning Placeholder for [description of work]`. Here's an example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408093.
    1. The description should have a link to the investigation issue, and a reminder to remove the weight and close it once the smaller replacement issues are created.
    1. The `~blocked` label can be applied so it is clear that this issue should is not ready for development. Unfortunately, we must still apply the `~Deliverable` label to this issue, because that is the only way we can associate it with the Iteration Cadence for velocity calculations.
3. Once the investigation and breakdown into smaller issues is complete, then the weight can be removed and the issue closed.

## 👏 Communication

The IDE Team communicates based on the following guidelines:

1. Always prefer async communication over sync meetings.
1. Don't shy away from arranging a [sync call](#-ad-hoc-sync-calls) when async is proving inefficient, however always record it to share with team members.
1. By default communicate in the open.
1. All work-related communication in Slack happens in the [#g_create_ide][slack] channel.

### ⏲ Time Off

Team members should add any [planned time off][paid-time-off] in the ["Time Off by Deel"](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/D019WTM2F99) slack app, so that the Engineering Manager can use the proper number of days off during capacity planning.

### 🤙 Ad-hoc sync calls

We operate using async communication by default. There are times when a sync discussion can be beneficial and we encourage team members to schedule sync calls with the required team members as needed.

## Automations

Automations should be set up via [triage-ops](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/) if possible.

### Automations for Remote Development Workflow

**NOTE: Some of the following automations related to iterations are currently blocked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384885.**

Ideally we should automate as much of the [Remote Development Planning Process](#-remote-development-planning-process) workflow as possible. 

We have the following automation goals for the Remote Development Workflow. Unless otherwise noted, these rules are all defined in the  [triage-ops `policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml` config file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blob/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml))

**Goal:** To ensure every issue in the category is assigned to an epic

**Automation:**
- Issues in ~"Category:Remote Development" but no epic assigned should get a warning comment (TODO: implement)

**Goal:** To ensure category issues show up on the Iteration Planning board

**Automation:**
- [Issues in `~"Category:Remote Development"` but no `~rd-workflow` label should be added to `~rd-workflow::unprioritized`.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L4)

**Goal:** To avoid premature assignment of specific milestones before an issue has gone through IPM, to avoid getting this warning: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/411933#note_1419147845

**Automation:**
- [Issues with a specific milestone but not in ~rd-workflow::prioritized should have the milestone automatically set back to `%"Next 1-3 releases"`.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L16)
- [Issues with a specific milestone but no weight should have the milestone automatically set back to `%"Next 1-3 releases"`.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L29)
- [Issues with a specific milestone but no iteration should have the milestone automatically set back to `%"Next 1-3 releases"`.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L41)

**Goal:** To ensure prioritized issues are in the correct state

**Automation:**
- Issues in ~rd-workflow::prioritized but not assigned to the current Iteration of the Iteration Cadence should automatically get assigned to the Current Iteration (TODO: implement)

**Goal:** To ensure closed issues are in the correct state

**Automation:**
- [Every Issue in `~"Category:Remote Development"` which is closed must have the `~rd-workflow::done` label applied.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L65)

**Goal:** Syncing Remote Development workflow and GitLab workflow labels

**Automation:**
- [Issues in ~rd-workflow::unprioritized but with no GitLab workflow label should have ~"refined" assigned.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L77)
- [Unstarted issues in ~rd-workflow::prioritized but with ~"refined" assigned should get ~"workflow::ready for development" assigned.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blame/master/policies/groups/gitlab-org/ide/remote-development-workflow.yml#L53)
- Can we assume that other subsequent workflow states are already handled by standard triage rules? If so, confirm and list/link them (TODO: implement)

**Goal:** Apply correct ~rd-workflow label to reopened issues

**Automation:**
- Re-opened issues which are open but in ~rd-workflow::done should have ~"rd-workflow::prioritized" assigned. (TODO: implement)
- Example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390597#note_1

**Goal:** To ensure issues and MRs are 1-1

**Automation:**
- Every MR in `~"Category:Remote Development"` must have the first line of the description matching: `Issue: <issue link>\n\n`. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html#linking-and-closing-issues-from-merge-requests  (TODO: implement)
- Every Issue in ~"Category:Remote Development" must have the first line of the description matching: "MR: <MR link>\n\n" or "MR: No associated MR\n\n". See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html#linking-and-closing-issues-from-merge-requests (TODO: implement)
