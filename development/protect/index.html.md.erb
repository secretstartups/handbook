The Protect engineering sub-department is responsible for the [Protect Stage](/handbook/product/categories/#protect-stage) of the product.


## Vision

Protect our users' applications, services, and infrastructure from the ever-evolving threat landscape.

## Sub-department development people leaders


<%=
departments = ['Protect']
department_regexp = /(#{Regexp.union(departments)})/

direct_team(role_regexp: department_regexp, manager_role: 'Director of Engineering, Sec')
%>

### Backend
<%=  direct_team(role_regexp: /Engineer(.*)Protect:Container Security/, manager_slug: 'thiagofigueiro') %>

### Frontend
<%=  direct_team(role_regexp: /Engineer(.*)Protect:Container Security/, manager_slug: 'frontend-engineering-manager-sec') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Protect/, direct_manager_role: nil, other_manager_roles: ['Frontend Engineering Manager, Secure:Threat Insights, Protect:Container Security', 'Backend Engineering Manager, Secure:Threat Insights, Protect:Container Security', 'Director of Engineering, Sec']) %>

## Open-source projects

The Protect uses and [contributes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/protect/general/-/blob/master/README.md#outgoing-mrs) to a number of open source projects including:
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [Cilium Network Policies for Kubernetes](https://github.com/cilium/cilium)
* [Falco Cloud-Native runtime security](https://falco.org/)
* [AppArmor operating system and application policies](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/home)

## Engineering Refinement & Planning

We are constantly iterating on our [planning process](./planning/) as a team. To maximize our velocity and meet our deliverables, we follow a [refinement process for all issues](./planning/#refinement).
