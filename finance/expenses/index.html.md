## Introduction

Welcome to the Expenses page!  You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here.  If you can't find what you are looking for, then:
- **Chat channel**: `#expense-reporting-inquires`
- **Email**: `ap@gitlab.com`

GitLab utitilizes Expensify as our team member expense reimbursement tool. All team members will have access to Expensify within 2 days from their hire date.  If you didn't receive an email from Expensify for your access, please contact ap@gitlab.com. Expense reports are to be submitted at least once a month. Additional information on getting started with Expensify and creating/submitting expense reports can be found [here.](https://docs.expensify.com/using-expensify-day-to-day/using-expensify-as-an-expense-submitter/report-actions-create-submit-and-close)

The procedure by which reimbursable expenses are processed varies and is dependent on contributor legal status (e.g. independent contractor, employee) and [subsidiary assignment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tax/#tax-procedure-for-maintenance-of-gitlabs-corporate-structure). Check with Payroll if you are unsure about either of these.

For general information and guidelines regarding the company expense policy, check out the section of our team handbook on [Spending Company Money](/handbook/spending-company-money). Managers and Accounts Payable team will review the expenses for compliance with the company travel policy.  The CEO will review selected escalations at least annually.

Team members should also consider the terms and conditions of their respective contractor agreements when submitting invoices to the company.

Team members in a US policy will be automatically reimbursed through Expensify after their report is "final approved" within 7 business days by Accounts Payable team. For all other team members, please see the reimbursement process below based on your location or employment status.

## Office Equipment and Supplies

The company will reimburse for the following items if you **need it for work or use it mainly for business**, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring payroll taxes. Please keep in mind that while the amounts below are guidelines and not strict limits, any purchase (other than a laptop) that will cost GitLab $1000 USD per item (or over) will require prior approval from your Manager and Accounting.

The below averages are what GitLab **usually** reimburses. If you prefer to spend more on a given item, that's OK considering the average price. You are also welcome to expense the `GitLab Average Price in USD` portion, and cover the rest with personal funds. For example, if you purchase a high-end Steelcase ergonomic chair, you are welcome to expense the average price per the table below and cover the rest with personal funds. We are encouraging our members to use their best judgment when spending the company's money. 

When reimbursing through Expensify please select "reimbursable" for the portion which GitLab will be covering, and add a note explaining the receipt difference. 

* Please note Expensify cannot sync "non-reimbursable" line items, only reimbursable line items are to be entered in Expensify.

Team members should not use a Corporate Credit Card to purchase office equipment for their personal workspace.  All office equipment purchases for a team member's personal workspace should be made on a personal credit card and expensed.  

For Laptop Purchases/Refreshes, please refer to [IT Ops Laptop](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) policy and procedure.

### Setting up a home office for the first time?

Take inspiration from our [all-remote page covering key considerations for a comfortable, ergonomic workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/). You can also consult the `#questions` and `#remote` channels in Slack for recommendations from other GitLab team members.

### Software
1. We have central [license management](/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#jetbrains) for you to
   request licenses for JetBrains' products like RubyMine / GoLand.
1. We do not issue Microsoft Office 365 licenses, as GitLab uses Google's G Suite
   ([Docs](/handbook/communication/#google-docs), Slides, Sheets, etc.) instead.
1. For security related software, refer to the security page for [laptop and desktop
   configuration](/handbook/security/#laptop-or-desktop-system-configuration).

### Hardware

It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Read [GitLab's guide to a productive home office or remote workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/), and use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask IT Ops (and in turn, IT Ops should update the list).

| Item                                                         | Average Price in USD | Importance | Why                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Height-adjustable desk](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#desks) | $300 - $500                 | 10/10      | We use our desks everyday and need them to be ergonomic and adjustable to our size and needs, whether that is sitting or standing. |
| [Ergonomic chair](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#chairs) | $200                 | 10/10      | We use our desk chairs hours at a time, and need them to be healthy, supportive, and comfortable. |
| [Headphones (wired or wireless, with mic ability)](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#headphones) | $100                 | 10/10      | We use our headphones everyday during our [meetings](/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/), to connect with our fellow team members. We need our headphones to be comfortable, functional, and great quality. |
| [External monitor](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#monitors) | $380                 | 10/10      | Finding a monitor that is large, comfortable to use with sharpness is extremely important for our eyes and health. |
| [Keyboard](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#external-keyboard-and-mouse) | $250                 | 10/10      | Find a keyboard that works for you and is comfortable for your workflow and hand size. |
| [Mouse or Trackpad](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#external-keyboard-and-mouse) | $80 or $145          | 10/10      | Find a mouse/trackpad that works for you and is comfortable for your workflow. |
| Laptop stand                                                 | $90                  | 10/10      | Your eyes and head must look at the same angle as you work and so your laptop must be elevated if you are working with an external monitor. |
| [Webcam](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#webcams)     | $80                  | 9/10       | If you would like a much better image quality than from the camera in your laptop, a webcam can make video conversation better. For those who interface routinely with clients, leads, and external parties, you may also consider a pricier [mirrorless or DSLR camera as a webcam](https://docs.crowdcast.io/en/articles/1935406-how-to-use-your-dslr-as-a-webcam). |
| [Dedicated microphone](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#microphones) | $130                 | 6/10       | For those who routinely interface with clients, leads, media, and external parties — or create regular content for GitLab channels — you may also consider a dedicated microphone to capture your voice with added richness and detail. |
| Portable 15" external monitor                                | $200                 | 9/10       | You have the freedom to work from any location, and having a portable monitor allows that your workflow does not suffer from being constrained to a single small laptop screen. |
| USB-C Adapter                                                | $80                  | 9/10       | Most MacBooks only have 1 free USB-C port, so an adapter with additional ports is a necessity. |
| HDMI / monitor cable                                         | $15                  | 9/10       | Find a quality cable so that the connection between your laptop and monitor is healthy and secure. |
| [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/store/)                     | $50                  | 8/10       | Per our [Security Practices](/handbook/security/), purchasing Yubikey is not mandatory, but is considered as an extra layer of authentication for better security. |
| Monitor Privacy Filter                                       | $80                  | 8/10       | Important if you work in public places and need to be certain your work cannot be seen. |
| WiFi Router with guest functionality                         | $80                  | 7/10       | If your existing router does not allow for isolating your work notebook from your personal devices in your home network, consider buying a router that does. |
| Ethernet connector                                           | $20                  | 6/10       | This is if you choose to connect to your internet directly versus by Wi-Fi. |
| Powerline / WiFi network extender                            | $50 - $100           | 6/10       | Useful for extending your home network to your workspace |
| Laptop bag or backpack                                       | $60                  | 7/10       | Carry your laptop and external monitor safely with this travel bag. We recommended you get a bag (or backpack) with straps so the device stays on you when you need your hands free. |
| [Earpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug) | $30                  | 7/10       | If you use your headphones at home but would like lighter headphones to use while on the go, these earpods are the way to go. |

### Other
1. Business cards ordered from Moo as per the [instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#business-cards) provided by the People Experience team.
	* Urgent Business cards needed for day of start can be requested by emailing people-exp@gitlab.com. As a last resort, Moo does offer 3 to 4 Day Express service.
1. Work-related books.

### Transport/Delivery of free procurements
Also feel free to check your local [Freecycle group](https://www.freecycle.org/) or similar second-hand/free markets when looking for equipment, especially furniture such as desks and chairs. GitLab will reimburse the cost of any transport and delivery services you need to procure the item(s) provided the total cost does not exceed the average spend for the item based on the table above.

### Not sure what to buy?

Look at our [equipment examples page](/handbook/spending-company-money/equipment-examples) to see some of the items that other GitLab team members have purchased, and please consider adding to the list if there's something you'd like to share.

### Reimbursements

The company will reimburse for the following expenses if you need it for work or use it mainly for business, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring taxes:
1. Mileage is reimbursed according to local law: [US rate per mile](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates), [rate per km in the Netherlands](http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto), or [rate in Belgium](https://fedweb.belgium.be/nl/verloning_en_voordelen/vergoedingen/vergoeding-voor-reiskosten). Add a screenshot of a map to the expense in Expensify indicating the mileage.
1. Internet connection subscription.
	* For employees outside the Netherlands: follow normal expense report process.
	* For employees in the Netherlands: fill in and sign the [Regeling Internet Thuis](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1J70geARMCjRt_SfxIY6spdfpTbv_1v_KDeJtGRQ6JmM/edit#heading=h.5x5ssjstqpkq) form and send it to the People Experience team at `people-exp@ gitlab.com`. The People Experience team will then send it to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The details of the payroll provider can be found in the PeopleOps vault in 1Password under "Payroll Contacts". 
1. VPN service subscription. Please read [Why We Don't Have A Corporate VPN](/handbook/security/#why-we-dont-have-a-corporate-vpn) for more information about VPN usage at GitLab.
1. Mobile subscription, we commonly pay for that if you call a lot as a salesperson or executive, or if your position requires participation in an oncall rotation. If your device cost is part of your monthly subscription cost, please do not include the device cost from the expense reimbursement.
1. Telephone land line (uncommon, except for positions that require a lot of phone calls)
1. Skype/Google Hangouts calling credit (uncommon, since we mostly use [internet-based services such as Zoom](/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls/))

### Coworking or external office  space
If working from home is not practical you may submit for reimbursement for the cost of a co-working space. This can include non-traditional spaces that require a recurring (full-time monthly) membership as long as you average at least ~4 working days per month at the space. If flexible membership options exist in the form of daily passes or hourly packages, then these can be expensed as well, as long as the prorated cost per month does not exceed that of a recurring membership subscription. For instance, if both the monthly subscription and a hypothetical 10-day pass is $200 USD, then you can only expense one such pass each month.

Any agreement must be between the team member and the co-working space (i.e. GitLab will not sign or appear on the agreement). All expenses must be submitted through the normal [travel and expense reimbursement policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#reimbursable-expenses). The Company will not be responsible for any expense that relates to office space subsequent to the termination of service between GitLab and the team member.



### Work-related online courses and professional development certifications

GitLab team members are allotted [$500 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) per fiscal year to spend on one or multiple training courses. Reimbursement past the [$500 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) total allotment requires manager approval, please follow the [Tuition Reimbursement](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#tuition-reimbursement) process in this case.
1. The company will pay for all courses related to learning how to code (for example [Learning Rails on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails)), and you may also allocate work time to take courses that interest you. If you are new to development, we encourage you to learn Git through GitLab, and feel free to ask any questions in the #git-help Slack channel.
1. Work-related conferences, including travel, lodging, and meals. If total costs exceed [$500 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/), reimbursement requires prior approval from your manager.
	* Before scheduling any travel or time off to attend a conference a team member should review the request with their manager. The manager will approve the request if the conference is work-related and the timing doesn't interfere with GitLab deliverables. After  manager approval the team member can schedule travel and will be reimbursed for related expenses.
	* We encourage people to be speakers in conferences. More information for people interested in speaking can be found on our [Corporate Marketing](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#speakers) page.
	* We suggest to the attendees bring and share a post or document about the news and interesting items that can bring value to our environment.
1. At GitLab the lingua franca is [US English](/handbook/communication/#american-english), when English is not your native language it can limit you in expressing yourself. The company will pay for certified English lanaguage courses online or in person. There is also the #lang-en channel in Slack to help with any English language questions you might have.

### Year-end Holiday Party Budget

In previous years, GitLab allocated [$100 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) per GitLab team member for a holiday event in December. We also encouraged GitLab team members to self organize holiday parties with those close by, but due to COVID restrictions in most countries, we have decided to have a more universal approach this year. We will update this policy again ahead of December 2021. For December 2020, the E-Group has decided to do company-wide swag and a per-person budget of $45 USD for a virtual holiday event that team members may self-organize. 

## Travel and Expense Guidelines

### Travel

1. If you are taller than 1.95m or 6'5", you can upgrade to Economy Plus. There is no dollar restriction on this since it will be hard to fit in economy with that height.
1. For flights longer than 8 hours, you can expense:
   * Up to the first [$300 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Business Class on flights longer than 8 hours if you are taller than 1.95m or 6'5".
    * Up to the first [$100 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Economy Plus (no height restriction) on flights longer than 8 hours.
1. GitLab does not cover expenses for significant others or family members for travel or immigration. This includes travel and visas for GitLab events.
	* There are other things that [the company will not reimburse](/handbook/finance/accounting/#8-employee-reimbursements---expensify), such as dog boarding.

For additional Company Travel related questions, please refer to our [Travel Handbook](/handbook/travel/#booking-travel-through-tripactions-) regarding booking travel through TripActions.

### Spend reduction

When reducing spend, we'll not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending.
Discretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and Contributes.
By reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of [increasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-–-soda’s-are-no-longer-free/).
Discretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals.
But we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members.
Instead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals.
Even if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here.

### Renting Cars

#### US and Canada

##### Third Party Liability

Purchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab’s insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental.

Purchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are foreign employees renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers' compensation would protect an injured US employee, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a foreign employee invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter.

##### Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver

**Do Not** purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles.
 If travel to Mexico is required, **purchase** the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply.

#### Countries other than the US and Canada

##### Third Party Liability

Purchase the liability insurance offered at the rental counter when traveling outside the US and Canada. Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance are required by law in almost every country. Please verify this coverage is included with the rental agreement.

##### Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver

Purchase the Collision Damage Waiver or Physical Damage Coverage offered by the rental agency when traveling outside the US and Canada.

In the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the foreign rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages.

### Virtual Meal with GitLab Team member(s)

Currently Suspended

### Something else?

No problem, and consider adding it to this list if others can benefit as well.

1. Customer/Partner Facing Events
    * Gala/Black Tie Events: Tuxedo or Gown Rental, $150-$225 USD per event.
    * The event must be customer specific and the invitation must state black tie only.

1. If you are a team member and incurred an expense charged in a currency different from the one you use to submit your invoices, use the conversion rates specified in the [global compensation section of the handbook](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates). If the expense currency doesn’t exist in that list, refer to the conversion rates in [oanda](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/). Make sure to set the expense date in the currency converter form.

    Accounts payable uses Tipalti to drive payment to the above policies. As part of onboarding a invitiation to the Tipalti portal will be sent. Please sign up and onboard only banking information, no tax information is needed. If set up of the personal Tipalti account is not completed in a timely manner, this may result in a delay of expense payment. 

	* For all team members being pay by Safeguard, iiPay, or Vistra, the approved expense amount will be deposited in your account with your monthly salary.

1. If you are a team member with a company credit card, your company credit card charges will automatically be fed to a new Expensify report each month.
