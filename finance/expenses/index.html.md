## <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Introduction

Welcome to the Expenses page!  You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here.  If you can't find what you are looking for, then:
- **Chat channel**: `#expense-reporting-inquires`
- **Email**: `ap@gitlab.com`

GitLab utitilizes Expensify as our team member expense reimbursement tool. All team members will have access to Expensify within 2 days from their hire date.  If you didn't receive an email from Expensify for your access, please contact ap@gitlab.com. Note: Ensure to opt-out from news by logging in and navigating to `Settings > Preferences > Contact Preferences` and un-checking the box at `Relevant feature updates and Expensify news`.

Expense reports are to be submitted at least once a month. Additional information on getting started with Expensify and creating/submitting expense reports can be found [here](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5922/deep-dive-day-1-with-expensify-for-submitters/p1?new=1).

### <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Redacting Personal Information from Receipts - A Caution
As the service does not require your personal information in order to process the reimbursement, we encourage you to redact your personal information before uploading receipts to protect your privacy. Managers should relay this caution to your team members, but we will no longer deny the expense report if receipt images contain personal information.

Consider redacting this information:

- Your shipping and billing address(es)
- Your credit card information
- Your full name
- Any other data that is personal to you that should not want publicly known

At a minimum, information about the items/products purchased and the total purchase amount should be visible so managers can validate the expense reimbursement amount requested along with the actual items and total purchase price.

The procedure by which reimbursable expenses are processed varies and is dependent on contributor legal status (e.g. independent contractor, employee) and [subsidiary assignment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tax/#tax-procedure-for-maintenance-of-gitlabs-corporate-structure). Check with Payroll if you are unsure about either of these.

For general information and guidelines regarding the company expense policy, check out the section of our team handbook on [Spending Company Money](/handbook/spending-company-money). Managers and the Accounts Payable team will review expenses for compliance with the company travel policy.  The CEO will review selected escalations at least annually.

Team members should also consider the terms and conditions of their respective contractor agreements when submitting invoices to the company.

Team members in a US policy will be automatically reimbursed through Expensify after their report is "final approved" within 7 business days by Accounts Payable team. For all other team members, please see the reimbursement process below based on your location or employment status.

## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Office Equipment and Supplies

The company will reimburse for the following items if you **require them to work efficiently**, and local law allows us to pay for them without incurring payroll taxes. Please keep in mind that while the amounts below are guidelines and not strict limits, any purchase (other than a laptop) that will cost GitLab $1000 USD per item (or over) will require prior approval from your Manager and Accounting. 

When you evaluate the value of additional efficiency, we encourage you to [spend company money like its your own](/handbook/values/#spend-company-money-like-its-your-own). This means weighing the cost of a dollar spent to the value that it brings to the business--just as you would assess a personal dollar that you spend against the relative benefit that it brings you.

When reimbursing through Expensify please select "reimbursable" for the portion which GitLab will be covering, and add a note explaining the receipt difference.

* Please note Expensify cannot sync "non-reimbursable" line items, only reimbursable line items are to be entered in Expensify.

Team members should not use a Corporate Credit Card to purchase office equipment for their personal workspace.  All office equipment purchases for a team member's personal workspace should be made on a personal credit card and expensed.

For Laptop Purchases/Refreshes, please refer to [IT Ops Laptop](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) policy and procedure.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Setting up a home office for the first time?

Take inspiration from our [all-remote page covering key considerations for a comfortable, ergonomic workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/). You can also consult the `#questions` and `#remote` channels in Slack for recommendations from other GitLab team members.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i>  Software


1. We do not issue Microsoft Office 365 licenses, as GitLab uses Google Workspace
   ([Docs](/handbook/communication/#google-docs), Slides, Sheets, etc.) instead.
1. For security related software, refer to the security page for [laptop and desktop
   configuration](/handbook/security/#laptop-or-desktop-system-configuration).


#### Individual Subscriptions

GitLab does not reimburse individual software subscriptions (e.g. Apple Music, Krisp, etc.). Software subscriptions should be set up through the [company procurement process](/handbook/finance/procurement/), or by [creating an access request for an existing company subscription](/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/).

##### Subscription Exceptions

Certain types of individual subscriptions are reimbursable, such as VPN service. If you are uncertain whether a particular service is reimbursable, please contact Finance in the `#expense-reporting-inquiries` channel.

If you need a short-term or individual software subscription, or a single-pay software license, please reach out to Finance in the `#accountspayable` Slack channel to discuss options before acquiring the software.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Hardware

It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Read [GitLab's guide to a productive home office or remote workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/), and use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask IT Ops (and in turn, IT Ops should update the list).

#### Expensing hardware outside of the US

**The prices in the table below can serve as reference for team members as they look into purchasing new equipment. As an all-remote global company, GitLab understands that prices might vary per region depending on taxes, tariffs and other factors. We ask team members to look into 2 or 3 different providers and compare prices before acquiring new equipment. If the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be close to the average price in the table below. In the event there are additional taxes or other fees in your region, please note this cost increase when submitting an expense report to ensure an efficient and speedy approval and reimbursement from our third party accounting team.**```

| Headphones (wired or wireless, with mic ability) | $100                                 | 10/10      | We use our headphones everyday during our meetings, to connect with our fellow team members. We need our headphones to be comfortable, functional, and great quality. Due to low audio quality we do not reimburse air-pods.                                                        |

You can expense up to two 16:9 monitors (1080p or 4K) if they are required/helpful for your role.                                                                |

Some team members prefer a single ultrawide monitor over multiple monitors.                                                                                      |

For those who interface routinely with clients, leads, and external parties, you may also consider a pricier mirrorless or DSLR camera as a webcam. |
| Portable 15" external monitor                    | $200                                 | 9/10       | You have the freedom to work from any location, and having a portable monitor allows that your workflow does not suffer from being constrained to a single small laptop screen.                                                                                                     |

You can also choose to extending your home network to your workspace by using a network extender.                                                                                                                    |

#### Adapters and cables

##### A note on HDMI and 4K@60Hz

If you need HDMI connectivity (e.g. to connect a TV, projector or monitor) and are looking for a USB-C adapter or hub that supports [4K resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) (3840 × 2160 pixels), be aware that most of the adapters and hubs on the market only support refresh rate of 30 Hz (i.e. 30 frames per second). This is ok for movies, but not great for interactive work. For example, mouse pointer will noticeably jump on a 30 Hz screen when you move it. Scrolling text is even worse. All that puts extra strain on your eyes. There are products that support refresh rate of 60 Hz and they cost roughly the same. Look for 4K@60Hz in product specification. If you bought one and it still does not give you the desired refresh rate, make sure your HDMI cable supports it. [HDMI 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_2.0) and newer cables do.

#### Monitors

##### Desktop monitors

Each person's monitor set up is a personal preference based on your own productivity. In recent years, many team members have decided to change from dual monitors to a single ultrawide monitor. Based on the table above, you can expense up to two 16:9 monitors (the reference price is $500 in the USA), or one ultrawide monitor (the reference price is $1000 in the USA). 

If you are an engineer or in a similar role, we encourage dual monitors or an ultrawide monitor. If you are not in an engineer(-like) role, you can make a choice based on your own personal preference and if it is required/helpful for your role and choose whether you want a single 16:9 monitor, dual 16:9 monitors, or a single ultrawide monitor.

When choosing monitors, it is important to keep in mind that there are different series of monitors with the same size. The Dell Professional (P#### models) and Ultrasharp (U models) series will have different price points based on the features and quality.

You may also want to buy a monitor arm for your desk that increases ergonomics. There are a wide variety of commodity brand monitor arms that are affordable such as the [Mount-It](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mount-It/Mount-It/page/294B8EE4-088D-4426-891E-036605A6CABA) brand.

    * Note: We do not recommend using AirPods in Zoom meetings if you are using a [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/) due to the audio quality issues. It is sometimes difficult to hear team members who are using the microphone on AirPods. [This may be due to AirPods automatically switching the microphones between left and right](https://authenticstorytelling.net/how-to-fix-your-airpods-microphone-to-work-better-on-phone-calls-and-not-cut-out/). This can be fixed by [setting the AirPods to use the audio mic from one or the other](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-connect-your-airpods-to-your-mac). Another option is to use an [external microphone](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#microphones). AirPods also have limited battery life, and we often see problems with them not lasting through multiple meetings. Consider options that will last longer and not cause interruptions.

Keep in mind, open-ear headphones can often be worn longer than in-ear or closed headphones.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Reimbursements

The company will reimburse for the following expenses if you need it for work or use it mainly for business, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring taxes:
1. Mileage is reimbursed according to local law: [US rate per mile](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates), [rate per km in the Netherlands](http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto), or [rate in Belgium](https://fedweb.belgium.be/nl/verloning_en_voordelen/vergoedingen/vergoeding-voor-reiskosten). Add a screenshot of a map to the expense in Expensify indicating the mileage.
1. Internet connection subscription.
	* For team members outside the Netherlands: follow normal expense report process.
	* For team members in the Netherlands: fill in and sign the [Regeling Internet Thuis](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1J70geARMCjRt_SfxIY6spdfpTbv_1v_KDeJtGRQ6JmM/edit#heading=h.5x5ssjstqpkq) form and send it to the People Experience team at `people-exp@ gitlab.com`. The People Experience team will then send it to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The details of the payroll provider can be found in the PeopleOps vault in 1Password under "Payroll Contacts".
  * This is a taxable expense for GitLab Ltd. team members assuming that the internet connection is used partially for personal use as well as business use.
1. VPN service subscription. Please read [Why We Don't Have A Corporate VPN](/handbook/security/#why-we-dont-have-a-corporate-vpn), and check out our [Personal VPN page](/handbook/tools-and-tips/personal-vpn/) regarding usage at GitLab.
1. Mobile subscription, we commonly pay for that if you call a lot as a salesperson or executive, or if your position requires participation in an on-call rotation. For on-call, you may expense the cost of your mobile phone service for the month when you begin your on-call rotation. This is limited to your service cost itself, not any costs relating to the phone device, to a personal hotspot device or to services for other people on your phone plan. You may include additional data charges in your expense report as we understand you may have plans outside of your normal workspace while you're on-call. 
1. Telephone land line (uncommon, except for positions that require a lot of phone calls)
1. Skype/Google Hangouts calling credit (uncommon, since we mostly use [internet-based services such as Zoom](/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls/))
1. Laptops, insurance and repairs
    1. The [IT Ops](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) page outlines laptop purchasing for new hires and for repairs and EOL for existing employees.
    1. Laptops paid for by the company are property of GitLab and need to be reported with serial numbers, make, model, screen size and processor to IT Ops by adding it to this form: [GitLab laptop information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUOlP11qeLdLZHTI62CFr7MSHAoI_1M6CRpnUA6fegkEKCOQ/viewform) for proper [asset tracking](/handbook/finance/accounting/#fixed-asset-register-and-asset-tracking). Since these items are company property, you do not need to buy insurance or an extended warranty for them unless it is company policy to do so (for example, at the moment we do not purchase Apple Care or extended warranties). You do need to report any loss following [Lost or Stolen Procedures](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#lost-or-stolen-procedures) or damage to IT Ops as soon as it occurs.
    1.  **Repairs to company issued equipment.**
        * If you need to replace a battery or something small that does not affect the productivity or speed of the device, please go ahead and get that small item replaced and expensed.
        * Please get approval from your Manager if your equipment appears to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Business Operations can advise on next steps to ensure you have the proper equipment to work.
        * For loaner laptops: Do not hesitate when expensing a loaner laptop while your primary laptop is being repaired. Use your best judgment identifying a local vendor. Please check out our [laptop repair](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptop-repair) page for more info.
1. English lessons. At GitLab the lingua franca is [US English](/handbook/communication/#american-english), when English is not your native language it can limit you in expressing yourself.


### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Coworking or external office  space
If working from home is not practical you may submit for reimbursement for the cost of a co-working space. This can include non-traditional spaces that require a recurring (full-time monthly) membership as long as you average at least ~4 working days per month at the space. If flexible membership options exist in the form of daily passes or hourly packages, then these can be expensed as well, as long as the prorated cost per month does not exceed that of a recurring membership subscription. For instance, if both the monthly subscription and a hypothetical 10-day pass is $200 USD, then you can only expense one such pass each month.

Any agreement must be between the team member and the co-working space (i.e. GitLab will not sign or appear on the agreement). All expenses must be submitted through the normal [travel and expense reimbursement policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#reimbursable-expenses). The Company will not be responsible for the deposit, and therefore will not reimburse for the upfront deposit. This will solely be the responsibility of the employee. In addition, the company will not be responsible for any expense that relates to office space subsequent to the termination of service between GitLab and the team member.


### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Work-related online courses and professional development certifications

GitLab team members are allotted [$10,000 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) per calendar year to spend on one or multiple training courses. Follow the process for submitting a [Growth and Development Reimbursement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit). Expenses related to reimbursement of tuition will be capped at $1,000 USD within Expensify. Anything over $1,000 USD must go through payroll for reimbursement. Team members must attach a proof of receipt screen shot of the submitted G&D form when submitting a expense report for tuition, while choosing the "Training" category option. Please note any sort of conference attendance should be categorized to "Conference Attendance", and follow the same G&D steps as outlined above with reimbursement in Expensify capped at $1,000 USD.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Team Manager Flower and Gift Purchases ###

Managers are able to send Gifts and Flowers on behalf of their team members in acknowledgment of significant life events such as the birth of a little one; well wishes ahead of surgery, or the loss of a loved one.

The event in question must pertain to a GitLab Team Member or the immediate family of a GitLab Team Member and will be allocated to the respective team members departmental budget - the spend range for significant life events is **$75 to $125**. 

Managers can facilitate the ordering of Flowers or Gifts for delivery, but please note that you are unable to send restuarant gift cards at this time.  In an instance where you would like to extend the offer of a meal or food delivery service, this will need to be expensed by the recipient for reimbursement.

When expensing Team member gifts please use the tag FY22_EmployeeGiftsFlowers.

### Team building Budget

In FY22, each eGroup member has been allocated $50 per team member per quarter for FY22-Q1 to FY22-Q3 for team building events. There is an additional budget for $100 per team member in FY22-Q4. More to come in the section below as we get closer to FY22-Q4.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Year-end Holiday Party Budget

In previous years, GitLab has allocated [$100 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) per GitLab team member for a holiday event in December. We also encouraged GitLab team members to self organize holiday parties with those close by, but due to COVID restrictions in most countries, we have decided to have a more universal approach this year. We will update this policy again ahead of August 2021. 

## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Travel and Expense Guidelines

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Travel

1. If you are taller than 1.95m or 6'5", you can upgrade to Economy Plus. There is no dollar restriction on this since it will be hard to fit in economy with that height.
1. For flights longer than 8 hours, you can expense:
   * Up to the first [$300 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Business Class on flights longer than 8 hours if you are taller than 1.95m or 6'5".
    * Up to the first [$100 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Economy Plus (no height restriction) on flights longer than 8 hours.
1. GitLab does not cover expenses for significant others or family members for travel or immigration. This includes travel and visas for GitLab events.
	* There are other things that [the company will not reimburse](/handbook/finance/accounting/#8-employee-reimbursements---expensify), such as dog boarding.

For additional Company Travel related questions, please refer to our [Travel Handbook](/handbook/travel/#booking-travel-through-tripactions-) regarding booking travel through TripActions.

### Spend reduction

When reducing spend, we'll not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending.
Discretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and Contributes.
By reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of [increasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-–-soda’s-are-no-longer-free/).
Discretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals.
But we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members.
Instead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals.
Even if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Renting Cars

#### US and Canada

##### Third Party Liability

Purchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab’s insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental.

Purchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are foreign employees renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers' compensation would protect an injured US employee, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a foreign employee invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter.

##### Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver

**Do Not** purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles.
 If travel to Mexico is required, **purchase** the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply.

#### Countries other than the US and Canada

##### Third Party Liability

Purchase the liability insurance offered at the rental counter when traveling outside the US and Canada. Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance are required by law in almost every country. Please verify this coverage is included with the rental agreement.

##### Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver

Purchase the Collision Damage Waiver or Physical Damage Coverage offered by the rental agency when traveling outside the US and Canada.

In the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the foreign rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages.

1. Customer/Partner Facing Events
    * Gala/Black Tie Events: Tuxedo or Gown Rental, $150-$225 USD per event.
    * The event must be customer specific and the invitation must state black tie only.

## <i class="far fa-flag" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Expense Reimbursement

1. Effective 2019-07-01, all expense reports must be submitted to your manager for approval prior to being sent to Montpac, and Accounts Payable for approval and reimbursement.
1. If you are a team member from Nigeria, please submit your expense in your salary invoice (a template can be found [here](/handbook/finance/#invoice-template-and-where-to-send)) with receipts attached to <nonuspayroll@gitlab.com>.  Please note, this is a temporary solution while we are transition over to a PEO.
1. If you are a team member and incurred an expense charged in a currency different from the one you use to submit your invoices, use the conversion rates specified in the [global compensation section of the handbook](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates). If the expense currency doesn’t exist in that list, refer to the conversion rates in [oanda](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/). Make sure to set the expense date in the currency converter form.
1. GitLab uses Expensify to facilitate the reimbursement of your expenses. As part of onboarding you will receive an invitation by email to join GitLab's account. Please set up your account by following the instructions in the invitation.
	* If you are a team member in Spain or France, please submit your expenses through Safeguard in-house expense reimbursement management system and also submit them through Expensify.  Accounts Payable will review, approve, and send the approval of your expense reports in Expensify to your gitlab email address.

## <i class="far fa-flag" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Non-reimbursable Expenses:

As we ask team members to [spend company money like its your own](/handbook/values/#spend-company-money-like-its-your-own), so try not to micromanage spending. Our spending sub-value works as the foundation of our expense philosophy when team members exercise thoughtful judgement in purchasing. Most team members do this, but there have been bad actors. Some examples of purchases that have raised eyebrows include:
1. Costume for the party at the end of Contribute.
1. Boarding expense for animals while traveling.
1. A $1700 office chair from a celebrity furniture maker.
1. A llama rental for a team event.
1. Meals during the Contribute when team members opt out of the company provided meal option.
1. Cellphones and accessories.
1. Travel related expenses for family members of GitLab employees.
1. Fitness equipment (treadmill, etc..) and gym membership.
1. Meals from co-working day(s).
1. Home office decor (picture frames, hanging plants, area rugs, book shelves)
1. Meals or beverages while attending co working space
1. Treadmill Desks
1. Portable Air Conditioners
1. Home Power Generators 
1. [Individual subscriptions ex. Krisp , apple music](#individual-subscriptions)

You should proactively engage your manager if you plan to make a work purchase that is outside of what would be considered standard by an average team member. 

In accordance with [Reimbursable Expense guidelines](/handbook/finance/accounting/#reimbursable-expenses), independent contractors should note which expenses are Contribute related on their invoices, prior to submitting to the Company.
