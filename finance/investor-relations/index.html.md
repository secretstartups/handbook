## Quarterly Earnings Process:

As a public company we share financial results publicly after the close of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year. For Q3-FY22, this happened six weeks after the close of the quarter, on December 6, 2021 at 1:30pm Pacific. The key deliverables for each earnings cycle are:
Earnings press release summarizing business & financial results, providing guidance
Earnings call with prepared remarks by CEO and CFO followed by Q&A with sellside analysts
Updated investor presentation , webcast, transcript, posted to ir.gitlab.com
File required forms with the SEC, e.g. 10-Q, 10-K, 8-K

A cross-functional working group collaborates on the earnings cycle each quarter. Key contributors are the e-Group, IR, FP&A, Accounting, PR, Exec Comms, and Legal teams. The DRI for this project is the CFO; each workstream has functional DRIs.

The timeline for each quarter is as follows. A detailed calendar with DRIs and precise date/times will be published each quarter for planning and scheduling purposes.
### One week before quarter end: 
1. CEO, CFO, CRO, CMO, CLO, Investor Relations, Corp FP&A discuss the top business & industry themes from the quarter
2. Based on messaging themes, IR to draft v1 of earnings call script and Q&A. Preliminary reviews are done with the CFO and CMO, followed by final reviews with the CEO to finalize the script before earnings call
### Two weeks after quarter end: 
1. Financials and metrics close
2. Accounting and FP&A provide summaries of quarterly results for inclusion into all deliverables

## Trading Window

We anticipate that our quarterly trading window will open the third trading day after the announcement of our quarterly results and that it will close again immediately prior to the last four weeks of the fiscal quarter, as indicated by an announcement made by the CLO. However, it is important to note that any quarterly trading window may be cut short if the CLO determines that material nonpublic information exists in such a fashion that it would make trades by directors, employees, and consultants inappropriate.
