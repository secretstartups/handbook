> _GitLab GK, GitLab Korea Limited, GitLab UK Limited, GitLab GmbH, GitLab PTY Ltd, GitLab Canada Corp., GitLab France SAS, GitLab Ireland Limited or GitLab Singapore Holding PTE LTD_

As we implement Coupa in a [phased approach](/handbook/finance/procurement/coupa-faq/#does-the-coupa-implementation-impact-all-gitlab-entities), Purchase Requests for all other GitLab entities will continue to use the existing procurement issues. Check the [Deep Dive on the Professional Services and all Other Purchase Types Request Process](/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-contract-professional-services/#-deep-dive-on-the-professional-services-and-all-other-purchase-types-request-process) section for a detailed walkthrough guide.

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Deep Dive on the Professional Services and all Other Purchase Types Request Process
Review the [Prior to Contacting Procurement](/handbook/finance/procurement/prior-to-contacting-procurement/) page first.

Complete Steps 1-2, the Intake Steps, with as much specificity and detail as possible. Consider that many of the approvers are just now learning about this purchase for the first time and have no context beyond what you share here. This is your chance to provide all information as clearly as possible to expedite approvals as quickly as possible!

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 1 | Business Needs Intake
This section articulates how the purchase is aligned with the current business needs. Completion of all fields is necessary for approvals. 
Any missing or incomplete fields will result in a delay to the review and/or approval of your request.

**Business Problem Statement**
   * Identify the business problem this purchase will solve. (i.e. Sometimes we share conflicting data with customers since team members are unable to share single source of truth data.)

**Business Solution Statement**
   * Identify specifically how this purchase will solve the business problem just identified. Include links to OKR's, PI's, etc. (i.e. Dedicate time for the manual data clean up so all teams are using the single source of truth to grow sales target (see OKR). Bring in a third party to complete the data clean up since we are resource constrained.)

**Description of Purchase**
   * Itemize exactly what we are buying and what do we get for it? (i.e. 200 hours of consulting, data clean up effort, testing and signoff over the course of 6 months at $2K a month for 6 months)

**Business Justification**
   * Provide 2-3 sentences justifying this spend. (i.e. SaaS tool is a $60K annual investment, due to the efficiencies it will provide we will save $20K in annual labor costs, and $65K in licensing from the old tool we will de-comission.)
   * **If the spend is >$50K,** a more detailed cost analysis is required for approval. Here are some thought starters:
      * Elimination of existing costs (i.e. $65K in terminated SFDC licenses)
      * Headcount savings (i.e. Efficiencies mean we can eliminate planned new hire next quarter for a savings of $25K)
      * Enabled time savings for team (i.e. Currently two team members spend a combined 20 hours a week doing this manually - this tool eliminates that by half. Work focus can shift to delibering Q4 OKR - insert link)
      * Enabled capability/services (i.e. Tool allows us to be compliant with new laws and we can now respond to 5% more RFP's)
      * Essential need (i.e. Note essential is reserved for core business items such as audit, email, laptops. It is not essential to a specific function or a specific OKR or PI, but essential to the company being able to function as a company.)

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 2 | Vendor Needs Intake
This section articulates the information regarding the vendor and the current contract and pricing (if any) that is being proposed. Completion of all fields is necessary for approvals. Any missing or incomplete fields will results in a delay to the review and/or approval of your request.

**Vendor Name, and URL**

**Vendor contact**
   * The vendor main point of contact for this purchase. More than likely this is the sales rep you are working with. 
   * We will use this name and email to execute the contract signature. If this field is not completed with the correct name and email, your contract signature will be delayed.

**Vendor billing contact**
   * This is NOT the same as the sales rep - even if the rep tells you so :)
   * This is the actual accounts payable contact who our AP team will be coordinating invoice payment with

**Unsigned contract/quotes**
   * This is where we will look to review the proposal if available.
   * If you have a renewal or a true up, attach the previous order form here so we can reference terms and pricing. Failure to attach will result in review and approval delays.

**Total Contract Value**
   * Identify the estimated contract value. If it is a multi-year term, identify both the annual and total value. 
      * Note we do not do multi-year agreements except in specific circumstances. 
      * If you believe this is a specific circumstance, identify that here, and add both our CFO and CEO as approvers in Step 4.
   * If this is a new vendor and your spend is greater than $100K, check this box and attach the competitive quote from 1-2 other suppliers.
      * For questions on vendor selection process see [Prior to Contacting Procurement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/prior-to-contacting-procurement/)
   * If this is a new vendor and your spend is greater than $250K, check this box and link the RFP issue here.
      * For questions on vendor selection process see [Prior to Contacting Procurement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/prior-to-contacting-procurement/)

**Personal Data Privacy Review**
   * If any personal data will be collected, hosted, shared, or processed in any way, a [Privacy Review Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Vendor-Procurement-privacy-review) MUST be completed. **Failure to complete this issue can result in a significant delay to the approval of your purchase.**
   * If this is a renewal or add-on, link to the previous Privacy Review issue to expedite review and approval. Note it was formerly referred to as a DPIA.
   * Review all information and detail on the [Privacy Review](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/#vendor-privacy-review-process) process.

**Data Category**
   * What type of data (if any) will be shared with this vendor AND from what systems? (e.g. sales data, customer usage data from SalesForce, Zuora, etc.)

**Contractor Involvement?**
   * State if there will be any professional services/contractors engaged as part of this purchase. Sometimes the software company will provide implementation support who would need access to our systems. If so, idenitfy if they will have access to non-public data. This is necessary for security and privacy review.

**Related Documentatioin**
   * Add links to any requirements, sales proposals, etc. that are relevant to this purchase.

**Marketing Campaign Finance Tag**
   * If, and only if, this is a marketing request related to a campaign, please add the tag directly from the finance budget doc here to avoid delays in budgeting and payments.

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 3 | Risk Assessment and Security Review
All third parties will undergo a Risk Assessment to determine if a full Security Review is needed as described in the [Third Party Risk Management procedure](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/risk-field-security/third-party-risk-management.html).

To expedite the security review process:

- **Provide Vendor Security Contact Name and Email Address to Risk and Field Security Team**
- **Notify the Vendor of GitLab's [Third Party Minimum Security Standards](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-minimum-security-standards.html)**
- **Ensure there is a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in place**

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 4 | Approvals
Tag your functional leader according to the [Authorization Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix) in the first section of the table.

Tag your finance business partner under Budget Approval.

Scroll to the bottom of the issue and select a due date, if relative, and we will do our best to accomodate. All reviewers and approvers are notified so long as you do not edit below the section that says DO NOT EDIT BELOW.

**SUBMIT YOUR ISSUE!**

Now the review and approval process can begin. 

**A contract can not be signed until each function has reviewed and approved**

Here is a deep dive summary on what each function is reviewing for approval:

**Functional Review and Approval**
1. Please consult the [Authorization Matrix](/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/) to determine who must sign off on Functional Approval and Financial Approval.  
1. The approval from the functional leader is confirming they approve this specific spend to this specific vendor, and that it aligns with their specific business goals as a functional leader.

**Budget Review and Approval**
1. Finance is responsible for confirming the purchase is in budget.
1. Finance is responsible for reviewing and validating the Business Justification. If questions or concerns on the Business Justification, fp&a partner will engage VP, Finance.
1. If the contract exceeds $100K, the CFO will be added as an additional approver.
1. Finance validates the Department, and GL Account.
1. Finance validates the correct entity:
   * PEO's, Contractors should be engaged with GitLab IT BV
   * Contract to be engaged locally when there is a GitLab entity available (e.g. Netherlands with BV, UK with Ltd et cetera)
   * If there is no GitLab entity available in the country of a vendor use GitLab Inc

**Security Review and Approval**
1. If a full Security Review is deemed necessary, the Risk and Field Security team has 10 business days to complete this review **from the time they receive all necessary documentation from the vendor**. 
1. Any observations will be posted in the issue. The Risk and Field Security team does not approve vendors. It is the responsibility of the Business Owner to accept or remediate the observations. 
1. If applicable, a [Privacy Review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Vendor-Procurement-Privacy-Review) may also be necessary. This review is done independent of the Security Review.

**Procurement Review and Approval**
1. Before approving issues, the procurement team verifies:
   * Correct purchase request issue type was used.
   * Correct individuals were tagged and have approved according to the [Authorization Matrix](/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/)?
   * Vendor Selection and Negotiation process was followed
   * Contract is Reviewed
      * Procurment confirms dollar amounts match, confirm currency, confirm entities match in quote, and general scope is addressed.
      * If entities do not match, procurement will tag the issue creator and budget approver to confirm which entity should be used. 
      * If negotiated, procurement owns all commercial terms in the contract review process.
2. Procurement Approval Authority
   * Procurement Ops Analyst can approve purchase requests up to $25K 
   * Purchase requests >$25K will be approved by the Sr. Mgr Procurement
3. Approval Process
   * In the event procurement approves the purchase request issue before the other approvers to avoid being a bottleneck, procurement will approve before all parties.
   * If this happens, procurement will note our approval as pending the remaining approvers. 
   * At this point it is the responsibility of the issue owner as the DRI to follow the remaining process and secure remaining approvals BEFORE obtaining contract signature.

**Legal Review and Approval**
1. Legal is responsible for reviewing vendor contracts and will adhere to the legal playbook.
1. A contract cannot be signed until it has been **stamped** with approval by the legal team. Once the legal team approves the contract, legal will upload the contract with the approval stamp. 

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 5 | Contract Signature
1. Do not send the contract to the authorized signatory until all approvals are received. Doing so can put GitLab in a direct financial and/or legal risk which could need to be escalated.
1. Once all approvals in the issue are received, send the contract to the authorized signatory:
     - Upload the contract with the legal stamp to DocuSign
     - If a legal stamp is not included in the issue, please request clarification from legal and/or procurement by tagging them in the contract issue or asking for clarification in the #procurement slack channel.
     - In the description field in DocuSign, paste the link to the vendor contract issue request to avoid delays in signature.
     - Enter the signatory's name and email in DocuSign
 1. Once the contract is signed by GitLab, send the contract to your vendor (if not already signed by the vendor) through DocuSign.

- Note: If your vendor has a signature tool they would like to use and all approvals have been received in the contract issue, request that the vendor send the final contract version with the legal stamp for signature and also include the issue link. This will avoid delays in signature.

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 6 | Upload Contract
 1. After the contract is signed by both parties, upload the fully executed contract to ContractWorks. You will need to upload the fully signed pdf into the folder labeled **01. To Be Standardized**, which in under the parent folder **01. Uncategorized**. Legal will then organize the contracts using their [instructions and best practices](/handbook/legal/vendor-contract-filing-process)
      - If you need access to ContractWorks, please process an access request [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Single+Person+Access+Request) or tag procurement at @gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team in the issue and we will upload the contract on your behalf.

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 7 | Create Professional Services Access Request (as needed)
   * Similar to our Access Request process for team members, we have an access request process for consultants or professional services providers. 
   * If the vendor requires access to systems to complete work, the vendor manager (ie. the GitLab team member who will manage the relationship with the temporary service provider, generally a people manager) is responsible for creation of a Vendor Access Request and Orientation issue. 

   * These issues aren't created in the same location as access requests for employees so find the link below so use this [access request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/contingent-workers/lifecycle/-/issues/new?issuable_template=access-request) and assign it to yourself and the relevant provisioner(s) for the tools that the professional services provider requires access to. 
   * In the AR, include [**only systems that are necessary**](/handbook/engineering/security/access-management-policy.html#access-management) to the work that the vendor will be performing. 

   * To support the service provider through the set up of the most common tools used at GitLab, an **[orientation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/contingent-workers/lifecycle/-/issues/new?issuable_template=orientation-issue) must be created**. Assign to yourself and the professional services provider if they have a GitLab account with the required access.

More information about this process can be found in the [Team Member Enablement handbook page](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/temporary-service-providers).

## <i class="fas fa-file-signature" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Step 8 | Accounts Payable
1. Vendors will be required to create an account within Tipalti in order to receive payment
1. For complete details on how to obtain payment, please visit Accounting's [Procure to Pay](/handbook/finance/accounting/#procure-to-pay) page.
1. If your annual contract value is equal to or greater than $100K, a Purchase Order must be created to pay the vendor. See Creating a Purchase Order for steps to do so.

If you have additional questions, please ask in #procurement slack channel. Or attend Purchasing Office Hours, available in the GitLab Team Calendar.

## How do I request approval for a purchase?

After the Vendor Contract Request issue is opened or the requisition is created in Coupa, Procurement will negotiate the best pricing up front to keep our ongoing costs to a minimum across our long-term realtionships with vendors. We also continue to evaluate supplier pricing at the time of renewal to minimize our ongoing costs across our long-term relationships with vendors.
> Create the requisition **BEFORE** agreeing to business terms and/or pricing.
