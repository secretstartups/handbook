## Home Office Equipment and Supplies

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Home Office Items

Below is a list of common items for your home office at GitLab. It is uncommon that you'll need all of the items listed below. Read [GitLab's guide to a productive home office or remote workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/), and use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask IT Ops (and in turn, IT Ops should update the list).

#### Expensing hardware and supplies outside of the US

**The prices in the table below can serve as reference for team members as you look into purchasing new equipment. As an all-remote global company, prices might vary per region depending on taxes, tariffs and other factors. When making a spend above $100 USD, we encourage team members to look into 2 or 3 different providers and compare prices before acquiring new equipment.** 

**For non-US team members: if the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be close to the average price in the table below. In the event there are additional taxes or other fees in your region, please note this cost increase when submitting an expense report to ensure an efficient and speedy approval and reimbursement from our third party accounting team.**

You can also choose to extending your home network to your workspace by using a network extender.                                                                                                                    |

#### Adapters and cables

##### A note on HDMI and 4K@60Hz

If you need HDMI connectivity (e.g. to connect a TV, projector or monitor) and are looking for a USB-C adapter or hub that supports [4K resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) (3840 × 2160 pixels), be aware that most of the adapters and hubs on the market only support refresh rate of 30 Hz (i.e. 30 frames per second). This is ok for movies, but not great for interactive work. For example, mouse pointer will noticeably jump on a 30 Hz screen when you move it. Scrolling text is even worse. All that puts extra strain on your eyes. There are products that support refresh rate of 60 Hz and they cost roughly the same. Look for 4K@60Hz in product specification. If you bought one and it still does not give you the desired refresh rate, make sure your HDMI cable supports it. [HDMI 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_2.0) and newer cables do.

#### Monitors

##### Desktop monitors

Each person's monitor set up is a personal preference based on your own productivity. In recent years, many team members have decided to change from dual monitors to a single ultrawide monitor. Based on the table above, you can expense up to two 16:9 monitors (the reference price is $500 in the USA) or one ultrawide monitor (the reference price is $1000 in the USA). 

If you are an engineer or in a similar role, we encourage dual monitors or an ultrawide monitor. If you are not in an engineer(-like) role, you can make a choice based on your own personal preference and if it is required/helpful for your role and choose whether you want a single 16:9 monitor, dual 16:9 monitors, or a single ultrawide monitor.

When choosing monitors, it is important to keep in mind that there are different series of monitors with the same size. The Dell Professional (P#### models) and Ultrasharp (U models) series will have different price points based on the features and quality.

You may also want to buy a monitor arm for your desk that increases ergonomics. There are a wide variety of commodity brand monitor arms that are affordable such as the [Mount-It](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mount-It/Mount-It/page/294B8EE4-088D-4426-891E-036605A6CABA) brand.
