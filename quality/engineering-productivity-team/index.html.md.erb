## Vision

The Engineering Productivity team increases productivity of GitLab team members and contributors by shortening feedback loops and improving workflow efficiency for GitLab projects. The team uses a quantified approach to identify improvements and measure results of changes.

### Mission

[Reduce pipeline cost](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#average-cost-per-merge-request-pipeline-for-gitlab), [reduce pipeline duration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#average-merge-request-pipeline-duration-for-gitlab), and [increase pipeline stability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#gitlab-project-master-pipeline-success-rate) for GitLab projects focusing on projects with the largest reach, leveraging GitLab features where possible.

Improve engineering workflow automation to [decrease mean time to merge](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#mean-time-to-merge-mttm), [decrease ~"bug" open past SLO](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#s1s2-open-bugs-past-target-slo), and [time to triage for new issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#new-issue-first-triage-slo).

Enable frequent and positive experience of Community Contributions from the Wider GitLab Community.

### Workstream objectives

The Engineering Productivity team focuses on the following workstreams and the associated Epics with workstream specific vision and objectives.

1. [GitLab triage reactive (aka serverless) operations] for issues, and merge requests.
1. [GitLab Triage] engine maintenance.
1. [GitLab Docs] (to be moved to a dedicated team in UX)

## Engineering productivity team metrics

The Engineering Productivity team creates metrics in the following sources to aid in operational reporting.

- [Sisense Quality Engineering KPIs](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/516343/Quality-KPIs)
- [Sisense Engineering Productivity Sandbox](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/496118/Engineering-Productivity-Sandbox)
- [Sisense Engineering Productivity Pipeline](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/564156/Engineering-Productivity---Pipeline)
- [Sisense Engineering Productivity Pipeline Durations](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/652085/Engineering-Productivity---Pipeline-Build-Durations)

### Product MRs merged per Product team member per month

This metric captures how many Merge Requests are merged into customer facing projects divided by the number of product team members.

Customer facing projects are projects which would come with an installation of GitLab. The current list can be found with all the projects identified in the [`projects_part_of_product.csv`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/transform%2Fsnowflake-dbt%2Fdata%2Fprojects_part_of_product.csv) file in the [`gitlab-data/analytics`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics) project.

Product team member is defined as all non-VP or Director role in Development, UX, Quality, and Product Management.

#### Requesting new projects to be included

With this measure, there is a preference towards adding new projects into the existing product. In the event that a new GitLab project is included in the product that a customer would receive then please open an issue [on the quality team tasks project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/new).

Within the issue, please add details on how this project is included with an Omnibus or Cloud Native installation of GitLab for consideration by the Engineering Productivity team. The team will evaluate the request and make any updates to charts and metrics in the sources listed above.

## Communication guidelines

The Engineering Productivity team will make changes which can create notification spikes or new behavior for
GitLab contributors. The team will follow these guidelines in the spirit of [GitLab's Internal Communication Guidelines](/handbook/communication/internal-communications).

### Pipeline changes

#### Critical pipeline changes

Pipeline changes that have the potential to have an impact on the GitLab.com infrastructure should follow the [Change Management](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management) process.

Pipeline changes that meet the following criteria must follow the [Criticality 3](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#criticality-3) process:

- update of the `CI_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT` CI variable
- update to the [`cache-repo` job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/cache-repo.gitlab-ci.yml) job

These kind of changes [led to production issues in the past](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3013).

#### Non-critical pipeline changes

The team will communicate significant pipeline changes to [`#development`](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C02PF508L) in Slack and the Engineering Week in Review.

Pipeline changes that meet the following criteria will be communicated:

- addition, removal, renaming, parallelization of jobs
- changes to the conditions to run jobs
- changes to pipeline DAG structure

Other pipeline changes will be communicated based on the team's discretion.

### Automated triage policies

Be sure to give a heads-up to `#development`,`#eng-managers`,`#product`, `#ux` Slack channels
and the Engineering week in review when an automation is expected to triage more
than 50 notifications or change policies that a large stakeholder group use (e.g. team-triage report).
