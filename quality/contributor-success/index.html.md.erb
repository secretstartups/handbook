## Strategy

This team directly follows the strategy outlined in our [open source growth strategy](/handbook/engineering/open-source/growth-strategy.html).

## Mission

The goal of the team is to increase the technical improvements and efficiency of our contribution process to sustain our
ambition of [1000+ contributors with merged MRs per month to GitLab](/company/strategy/#2-build-on-our-open-core-strength).

### FY23 Direction

In FY23 we will be focused on growing the number of unique new monthly contributors, reducing [Open Community MR Age
(OCMA)](#open-community-mr-age-ocma) and increasing [MRARR](#mrarr). This will increase development velocity without
requiring additional engineering resources.

Parallel to this we'll increase 
[observability of community contributed value](#community-contributed-value-observability) through improving the 
business intelligence around it. This will allow us to create some predictability through 
[foreshadowing](#community-metrics-foreshadowing). These efforts are cross-functional and require working together 
with Marketing and Product Development.
This accounts for 70 - 80% of the workload. The remaining 20 - 30% is ad-hoc work. The ad-hoc work is eclectic and
ranges from supporting customers on contributions, supporting various open source initiatives and supporting the
[Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/).

#### Unique New Monthly Contributors

1. Minimize reliance on human interaction
1. Reduce volatility through introducing [automations](#community-merge-request-workflow-automations) that drive contributions
   forward automatically
1. Capitalize on untapped potential - MRs that have become stale but have received a seal of approval as useful addition to GitLab.
1. Invest into attracting more new contributors

#### Community Contributed Value Observability

1. Introduce measurement points in various places in the contribution pipeline
1. [Collect objective and subjective feedback from contributors about the process](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#code-review-experience-feedback)
1. Create insight into actual community contribution pipeline size
1. Standardize contribution MRARR valuation
1. Categorize contribution and measure value per type

#### Community Metrics Foreshadowing

1. Predict community metric trends
1. Empower teams to react to negative trends before they actualize
1. Define ambitious targets for FY24

#### Open Community MR Age (OCMA)

1. Minimize reliance on human factors that contribute to a large standard deviation
1. Identify & drive tooling improvements to decrease OCMA, and collaborate with the [Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/) 
through shared tooling for [automated triaging](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/#automated-triage-policies)

#### Leading Organizations

The GitLab [Leading Organizations program](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/leading-organizations/) is a
cross-functional initiative that is led by the [Contributor Success team](/handbook/engineering/quality/contributor-success/) 
and [Community Relations team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/). 

The Leading Organization program supports GitLab's [mission](/company/mission/#mission) by recognizing and incentivizing
organizations who are among our most active contributors. A company or individual
[qualifies](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/leading-organizations/#qualification) for unique benefits by
reaching 20 merged merge requests or more over a trailing three full calendar month basis.

Please see [Contributing Orgs tracker](contributing-org-tracker.html) for details how to onboard or offboard a Leading
Organizations from our PI's, SLO's & Dashboards.

### File an issue

#### gitlab-org/gitlab

All issues that relate to the Open Source project GitLab and that can serve to enhance the contributor flow and are public by nature should be created here by default. We aim to not have any distinction between contributors or GitLab team-members for which we expect by default that everyone should be able to contribute to. 

* Location: [gitlab-org/gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
* Required label: `Contributor Success`

#### gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task

All issues that relate to the inner working of the company GitLab, including specific internal team workings, onboardings-issues or issues relating to customers that should be separated from the Open Source project GitLab can be placed here.

* Location: [gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task/)
* Required label: `Contributor Success`

## Project Management

* Our [team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task) is our single source of truth for all tasks & backlog.
* Epics that contain cross-functional work across multiple departments can be created at the `gitlab-org` [level](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?label_name[]=Contributor+Success).

## Working with community contributions

### Community contribution labels

- The `Community contribution` label is automatically applied by the [GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot) to MRs submitted by wider community members. 
  * You can see the list of MRs in [`gitLab-org` list of merge requests](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/merge_requests?label_name[]=Community+contribution).
  * [Learn more about the cadence and conditions for this automation](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#community-contributions).
- The `1st contribution` label is added to first-time contributions. Every time a contributor is opening a merge request under the `gitlab-org` namespace for the first time, the label `1st contribution` is automatically applied to the merge request.
  - You can see the list of MRs in [`gitlab-org` list of merge requests](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/merge_requests?label_name%5B%5D=1st+contribution).
  - [First-time contributors](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#first-time-contributors) are also awarded a gift as our way to say thanks.

### Community issues workflow manual process

1. If the issue is spam, [report the abuse](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/abuse_reports.html) and make the issue confidential. Flag the report that is raised in the [`#abuse`](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C0HPYBJ3D) Slack channel with a link to the issue and alert the `@abuse-team`.
1. If the issue is a request for help, you can use this template to provide resources and close the issue:

    ```
    Hey @author. Based on the information given, this request for support is out of the scope of the issue tracker (which is for new bug reports and feature proposals). Unfortunately, I won't be able to help get it resolved. However, for support requests we have several resources that you can use to find help and support from the Community, including:
    * [Technical Support for Paid Tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/support/)
    * [Community Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/)
    * [Reference Documents and Videos](https://about.gitlab.com/get-help/#references)

    Please refer to our [Support page](https://about.gitlab.com/support/) for more information.

    If you believe this was closed in error, please feel free to re-open the issue.

    /label ~"support request"
    /close
    ```
    * If the issue is re-opened after you closed it, you should get an email notification and would then be responsible for re-evaluating the issue.
    * (Optional) Alternatively, instead of closing the issue when using the template above, you could take on the role of customer support and ask the reporter for more information so we can properly assist them. If you do this, add the ~"awaiting feedback" label.
1. Check for [duplicate issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#duplicates). If identified as a duplicate, the new issue can be closed with a note similar to:

    ```
    Hey @author. Thanks for creating this issue, but it looks like a duplicate of #issue. I'm closing this issue in favour of #issue.

    Please add your thoughts and feedback on #issue (don't forget to upvote feature proposals).

    /duplicate #issue
    ```
    * Do not make any forward looking statements around milestone targets that the duplicate issue may be assigned.
1. If it is unclear whether the issue is a bug or a support request:
    * `@mention` the PM/EM for the [relevant group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-categories/#devops-stages) and ask for their opinion.
1. Add a [type label](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#type-labels).
    * If identified as a bug, add a [severity label](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels).
    * If the severity is ~"severity::1" or ~"severity::2", [mention relevant PM/EMs from the relevant stage group from product devstages categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages).
1. Add a [stage label](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#stage-labels).
1. Add a [group label](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#group-labels).
1. Add relevant [category](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#category-labels) labels to facilitate automatic addition of stage and group labels.
1. If needed, [mention relevant domain experts](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#expert) if the issue requires further attention.

### Community merge request workflow automations

Community merge requests are MRs opened by a person that's not present on https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/ (excluding any bot and service account users).

#### Triage reports

See [Community-related triage reports](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#community-related-triage-reports).

#### Scheduled workflow automation

See [Community-related scheduled workflow automation](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#community-related-scheduled-workflow-automation).

#### Reactive workflow automation

See [Community-related reactive workflow automation](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#community-related-reactive-workflow-automation).

### Merge request coaches

[Merge request coaches](/job-families/expert/merge-request-coach/) are available to help contributors with their MRs. This includes: 
- Identifying reviewers for the MR.
- Answering questions from contributors.
- Educating contributors on the [contribution acceptance criteria](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#contribution-acceptance-criteria).
- Or completing the MR if the contributor is unresponsive or unable to complete.
  - In that case, the `coach will finish` label will be added to the MR and the coach will either directly push new commits to the MR, or re-create a new MR with the original changes. 
  - Contributors can mention the coaches in their MRs by typing `@gitlab-org/coaches`.

The list of current merge request coaches can be found in the [team page](/company/team/) by selecting `Merge Request
Coach` in the department filter.

There is also the [`#mr-coaching`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C2T9APP9C) channel in GitLab Slack if GitLab team
members have any questions related to community contributions.

More information on merge request coaches (including how to become a merge request coach) can be found in the 
[MR coach lifecycle page](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/resources/merge-request-coach-lifecycle.html).

### DCO and CLA Guidance

All external contributions to GitLab are subject to the [GitLab DCO or CLA](/community/contribute/dco-cla/), depending
on where the contribution is made and on whose behalf.

Instructions for corporate contributors to enter into an overarching Corporate CLA covering all contributions made on
their behalf are set out on the [DCO-CLA page](/community/contribute/dco-cla/#need-a-corporate-cla-covering-all-contributors-on-behalf-of-your-organization). 

## Recognizing contributors 

We work with the Community Relations team, to [recognize contributors](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#recognition-for-contributors) 

A nomination process is also available to [nominate a contributor](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/community-appreciation/)

## Contributor Growth stand-up

The purpose of this stand-up is to collaborate cross-functionally between various teams and GitLab team members on
initiatives for how to reach our goal of 1000 contributors per month. This is a subset of the User Engagement top
initiative: [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com-top-initiatives/-/epics/8](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com-top-initiatives/-/epics/8)
