## Overview
{: #overview .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

This page focuses on emails and nurture programs, owned and managed by Marketing Campaigns. The Campaigns Team is heavily focused on building a key element to driving top-funnel demand generation: an "always on", logic-based and persona-driven nurture engine.

**When our ideal state top-funnel demand gen nurture engine is in place, we will be able to provide the *right offer* to the *right person* at the *right time* - based on their placement in the buyer journey (lead funnel) and their areas of interest, and in some cases, their location.**

**Key foundational elements to achieve this:**
* A strategically segmented Marketo database
    - this is an ongoing effort led by MOps in collaboration with Campaigns
    - *please see [note below regarding segmentation and email requests](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/emails-nurture/#ad-hoc-one-time-emails---requesting-an-email)*
    - [see the overall database segmentation epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1331)
    - [see this epic for more campaign-based tactical segmentations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1467)
* A persona-based prescriptive buyer journey
    - this is an ongoing effort led by Campaigns in collaboration with Content Mktg, Product Mktg, Technical Mktg
    - [see the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1530)
* Logic-based Marketo nurture programs by segment
    - this is an ongoing effort led by Campaigns, and specifically spearheded by our Email Marketing Campaign Manager @nbsmith.
    - [see this epic for holding location of projects to be prioritized](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1040)

### Nurture entry (system logic and manual flow)
{: #nurture-entry}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**Note: in our future state nurture system, leads would be nurtured appropriately through logic based on:**
* Stage in the buyer lifecycle
* Indicated GTM Motion(s) of interest (either through inbound source, self-selected, or segmentation)

These future state nurture programs will be aligned to GTM Motions, with three streams to clearly designate the stage of the [buyer journey](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/content/#content-stage--buyers-journey-definitions) (Awareness, Consideration, and Purchase/Decision) and therefore deliver content relevant to their stage of the buyer journey.

#### Add to nurture within Marketo programs
{: #add-to-nurture-in-program}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

These smart campaigns are in Marketo program templates in order to add leads to nurture programs. This is the interim of building an automated Nurture Logic Engine, which will enable a more scaled and efficient approach.

**Review the smartlist and run:**
* Smart List (filter):
    - Member of Program: (current program, success status) - `NOTE: These are pre-built in the templates, no need to edit!`
    - Subscription Filters (fitlers here are dependent on program type, and subject to change, so not adding all details)
    - Not in a trial
    - Not on an open opportunity
* Flow
    - Add to nurture:
       - Select the program indicated in the issue description (should include one of the [active nurture program options](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/emails-nurture/#gtm-motion-nurtures))
       - Select the stream indicated in the issue description (should be awareness, consideration, OR decision/purchase)
* Schedule
    - Select `Run Once` > Choose `Run Now` > Click `Run`

#### Requesting to add leads to a nurture program
{: #add-to-nurture-request}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

While the future automated nurture system is in progress, to request to add a segment of leads to a nurture, please create an add-to-nurture issue request:
   - If Field Marketing is DRI: [request-add-to-nurture](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request_add_nurture)
   - If any other team is DRI: [request-add-to-nurture](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-add-nurture)

These issue templates are also built into the epic codes throughout the handbook accordingly. As the overarching automated nurture logic is created, AND epic codes consistently indicate the required details for the logic, we will discontinue use of these issue templates.

## Newsletter
{: #newsletter .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Process for bi-weekly newsletter
{: #newsletter-process}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Open an issue using the [Newsletter Request Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-email-newsletter), including the newsletter send date in the issue title.

**[Epic of Past and Upcoming Newsletters](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/179)**

#### Creating the newsletter in Marketo
{: #newsletter-marketo-creating}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

A day or two before the issue due date, create the newsletter draft. It's easiest to clone the last newsletter in Marketo:

1. Go to Marketing Activities > Master Setup > Outreach > Newsletter & Security Release
1. Select the newsletter program template `YYYYMMDD_Newsletter Template`, right click and select `Clone`.
1. Clone to `A Campaign Folder`.
1. In the `Name` field enter the name following the newsletter template naming format `YYYYMMDD_Newsletter Name`.
1. In the `Folder` field select `Newsletter & Security Release`. You do not need to enter a description.
1. When it is finished cloning, you will need to drag and drop the new newsletter item into the appropriate subfolder (`Bi-weekly Newsletters`, `Monthly Newsletters` or `Quarterly Newsletters`).
1. Click the + symbol to the left of your new newsletter item and select `Newsletter`.
1. In the menu bar that appears along the top of your screen, select `Edit draft`.

#### Editing the newsletter in Marketo
{: #newsletter-marketo-editing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

1. Make sure you update the subject line.
1. Add your newsletter items by editing the existing boxes (double click to go into them). It's best to select the `HTML` button on the menu bar and edit the HTML so you don't inadvertently lose formatting.
1. Don't forget to update the dates in the UTM parameters of your links (including the banner at the top and all default items such as the "We're hiring" button).

#### Sending newsletter test/samples from Marketo
{: #newsletter-marketo-testing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

1. When you're ready, select `Email actions` from the menu at the top, then `Send sample` to preview.
1. Enter your email in the `Person` field, then in `Send to` you can add any other emails you'd like to send a preview too. We recommend sending a sample to the newsletter requestor (or rebecca@ from the content team for marketing newsletters) for final approval.
1. When you are satisfied with the newsletter, select `Approve and close` from the `Email actions` menu.

#### Sending the newsletter
{: #newsletter-marketo-sending}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

1. When the edit view has closed, click on the main newsletter item in the left-hand column.
1. In the `Schedule` box, enter the send date and select `Recipient time zone` if the option is available.
1. Make sure `Head start` is checked too.
1. In the `Approval` box, click on `Approve program`.
1. Return to the newsletter issue and leave a comment telling requestor  to double check all has been set up correctly. Close the issue when this is confirmed.

## Ad-hoc (one-time) emails - requesting an email
{: #one-time-emails .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Important note regarding audience segmentation efforts and efficiency
{: #note-audience-segmentation}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Until our foundational Marketo database segmentations (noted in the overview at the top of this handbook page) are rolled out, there are challenges in targeting audiences efficiencly. If you would like to propose an MVC email, please remember that the tactical execution may be beyond bandwidth constraints.

#### Email Request Issue Template
{: #email-request-issue}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**PLEASE READ IMPORTANT NOTE IN SECTION ABOVE PRIOR TO SUBMITTING**

To request an email send, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-email) for consideration of your MVC email idea, and provide as much detail as possible (especially around the audience), and please respect if the determination is that "the juice isn't worth the squeeze" and that we may want to delay the launch until some foundational audience segmentations are established. Please review the `Email Review Protocol` section below for more detail.

**SLA:** There is a standard 5 Business Day SLA in place for new email requests. All details in the "Submitter Checklist" of the issue must be complete in order to be triaged to the appropriate Campaign Manager.

**Urgent security emails are exempt from this SLA.*

All links in email sends, going to about.gitlab.com will need to be appended with utm parameters, following the nomenclature outlined in this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12jm8q13e3-JNDbJ5-DBJbSAGprLamrilWIBka875gDI/edit#gid=0). This is the way we track and give attribution to emails.

#### Need-to-know details for the email request
{: #email-request-details}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Below are the information from the issue template that will need to be filled out before the Campaign Manager will create the email in the appropriate system:

- **Sender Name**: Typically we use GitLab Team for most outgoing communications; for Security Alerts we use GitLab Security. Choosing a name that is consistent with the type and/or content of email being sent is important, if unsure make a note and we will make recommendation.
- **Sender Email Address**: What email address should be used?
- **Approvers**: All approvers must be listed on the email request. At least one individual who will receive the replies to the email must be listed an as approver. For example, if the email is coming from security@, someone who will receive replies to the email should be listed as one of the approvers. See approval table below.
- **Subject Line**: 50 character max is preferred (30-40 characters for mobile devices)
- **Email Body Copy**: Can be a text snippet within issue, clearly identified comment on issue or attach a Google Doc with copy. The copy must be approved before requesting the email.
- **Target Date to Send Email**: at a minimum a few days notice is preferred because we need to balancing the number of emails being sent to our database so they are not perceived (or marked) as spam; however, a simple email can be turned in a few hours if absolutely necessary
- **Recipient List**: Emails can be sent to one of the [existing segments](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo#geographic-dma-list ) or a recipient list can be provided as a .csv file
    -  Audience should be appropriately segmented and tokens selected for personalization (if applicable)
    -  All subscribers are selected list are opted-in to receive your message
    -  If supplying a .csv file, the file must include the following fields:  Email address, First Name (or Full Name)
    -  If personalizing the email to reference a specific project or page, that field must be included in the .csv file and clearly marked using the same terminology used in the email copy. The email copy must clearly identify {{Project}}or {{Page}}where the applicable personalization should be inserted.

#### Types of email requests
{: #email-request-types}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

- **Marketing Emails**: Marketing emails are designed to generate leads. The request process outlined is used for ad-hoc marketing emails (not events, webcasts, integrated campaigns, etc as these all have a separate established process). These emails are sent through Marketo using the marketing database or [existing segments](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#geographic-dma-list).
- **Terms of Service or Privacy Policy Updates**: Terms of Service or Privacy Policy emails are sent to the user base and are not marketing-related. These emails are sent through MailChimp and may require additional approvals, based on the content or number of recipients.
- **Support emails**: Support emails are typically sent to a subset of impacted users and are not marketing-related. These emails are sent through MailChimp.
- **Security emails**: Security emails are sent either to the entire user base or a subset of users and are not marketing-related. They are often urgent, but in the case of the monthly security release, they are scheduled. The monthly security release email is sent through Marketo. Urgent notifications are typically sent through MailChimp.

#### Approvals and notifications for email requests
{: #email-request-approval}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Marketing related ad-hoc emails are sent at the discretion of the Campaigns team.

Terms of Service or Privacy Policy updates that impact all users must be announced on the company meeting, in the `#whats-happening-at-gitlab` and `#community-advocates` Slack channels, and approved according to the table below prior to submitting the Email Request.

Support and Security emails sent to a small subset of users should be announced in `#community-advocates` and `#support_escalations` Slack channels, and mentioned in `#whats-happening-at-gitlab` if relevant.

The approval table below applies to non-Marketing emails.

|  **Users to be contacted** | **Approval by** |
| --- | --- |
|  < 1,000 | reply-to owner |
|  1,001-4,999 | PR, reply-to owner, community advocate |
|  5,000-499,999 | PR, reply-to owner, community advocate, director+ in originating department |
|  500,000+ | PR, reply-to owner, community advocate, director+ in originating department, e-group member |

## Email marketing best practices
{: #best-practices .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

### Email content best practices
{: #best-practices-content}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*  Email copy should be shorter and more conversion-oriented
*  Avoid walls of text when possible
*  Use extremely clear wording and remove words that don't provide value
*  Minimize CTAs (calls-to-action)
*  Take advantage of content hierarchy
*  Use humor when it makes sense
*  Craft compelling subject lines and employ the preview text as a complement to the subject line
*  Focus on value-first content and CTAs. Ask yourself: "what's in it for the subscriber?"
*  Make sure that the size of your HTML file does not exceed 102kb, otherwise gmail will truncate your email and your email will be out of compliance.

### Design best practices
{: #best-practices-design}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*  Consider resposive design
*  Code all text in HTML
*  Minimize CTAs
*  Images should add to the goal of your email and not take away from it
*  An email is not a landing page
*  Consider accessibility

### A/B testing best practices
{: #best-practices-testing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*  Each test group should include at least 1000 people
*  You need a bigger test group if you're testing for click-through rate versus testing for open rate
*  Have a goal and idea regarding what you want to improve and how your test is going to help with that
*  Test _one_ variable at a time
*  Due to our small sample sizes, we recommend a full 50/50 split versus a 10/10/80 or 20/20/60 split
*  Remember your subject line or "from name" (testing open rates) could have an impact on click-through rate and conversion rate
*  Let the Campaign Manager know at the beginning of the project if you're interested in running an A/B test and what your goals/hypothesis is
*  Keep track of the split test learnings so we can learn and innovate!

## Email Templates
{: #email-templates .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**What are email templates?** An email template is a reusable HTML file that is used to build email campaigns (according to Litmus).

**Why are email templates important?** Using an email template allows you to produce campaigns faster, since the underlying code is already written. Instead of having to rewrite an entire email from scratch for every send, you can simply add copy, images, and links to an existing template before testing and sending it to your subscribers (according to Litmus).

**What email templates are available for us to use?** In Marketo (Design Studio > Email Templates), the following email templates are available:

Standard marketing campaign email templates
- A - Event Invite v2.0
- B - ABM Email Template v1.0 **(WIP)**
- C - Invite with date & time v1.0 **(WIP)**
- D - Nurture standard v1.0 **(WIP)**
- E - Corp Event v1.0 **(WIP)**
- F - Newsletter standard v1.0 **(WIP)**
- G - Newsletter dark mode v1.0 **(WIP)**
- H - Letter format v1.0 **(WIP)**

Other email templates
**(WIP)** currently but will include notification alert emails.

If you don't have Marketo access and would like to see what the email templates look like, [please view the project Epic and corresponding issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/759).

**NOTE:** It is very important that you format your copy to align with the design of the email template you're using. This will improve efficiency of building emails, and ensure copy is best fit to the layout.

**What if I want a custom email template?** You may submit a request for a custom layout, but please note that the critical priority currently is to efficiently launch emails and nurtures into market. In your [request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new), please tag @nbsmith and clearly describe why the existing layout is not satisfactory, how often and broadly the requested template will be used, and quantifiable benefits we anticipate from the new layout. To reiterate: Upon implementation of the critical emails and nurtures, we plan to devote more time and energy to developing and testing new templates, however the launch of lifecycle emails takes precedence over these requests.


## Email review protocol
{: #review-protocol .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

All Campaign Managers and reviewers should adhere to the following protocol for every marketing email that is sent to ensure brand consistency and quality in our email program.

We use both Marketo and Mailchimp to send ad-hoc emails. Marketo is the primary system for all marketing emails and the regularly scheduled security updates. Mailchimp should be used for emails to gitlab.com users as these users are not in our marketing systems (unless they have signed up for content). *Examples of emails to be sent through Mailchimp: Critical security updates, support updates that impact a specific subset of users, suspicious account activity notifications.*

 - Once an email request is received using the process above, the Campaign Manager determines which system to send the email from. This is usually Mailchimp unless it is a marketing email to our database.
 - Log into Mailchimp and select "Audience."
 - Select "View Audiences" from the "Manage Audience" drop down on the right side of the screen.
 - Select "Create Audience" and name the audience using ISODate_CampaignName. Complete the Default From email address and name (usually info@, but can be security@ or support@ depending on the email). For "Remind people how they signed up to your audience" select "Entire Database" then click Save.
 - For instructions on adding contacts, review this [documentation](https://mailchimp.com/help/import-contacts-mailchimp/). You can also copy and paste the contacts if the list is small enough. You will be asked to map the fields on your import to the database fields prior to upload.
 - Select "Campaigns." Find a prior campaign that used the same type of email you want to use (plain text or regular). Security emails, privacy policy updates, and terms of service updates use plain text, support emails can use regular.
 - Select replicate, then select the audience you created above. If you do not have the list yet, you can select an existing audience and change it later during the review process.
 - Name the campaign using ISODate_CampaignName. Lay out the email as normal. For information about using Merge Tags, review this [documentation](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-merge-tags/).
 - Send a test email to yourself first to confirm email is correct and the links work properly. Then, make any changes and send a test to the designated approvers.
 - Once fully approved, review the audience (and update if necessary), sender, subject line, email and schedule to send.

## Sales nominated flows in Marketo
{: #sales-nominated .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In some cases, when invitations need to be more specific for an event, the Sales Nominated flows are used to allow sales to nominate who will receive the invite.

Note: if someone is nominated, but is unmailable (due to unsubscribe, invalid email, or hard bounce), they will not receive the invitation.

### Activating the sales nominated flow in Marketo
{: #sales-nominated-activation}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Sales Nominated automation smart lists are applied to Marketo program templates where sales nominated flows are relevant.

**Review the Email**:

Send sameple to the DRI for the program (i.e. workshop owner) who is responsible for testing and QAing the email. The email can be found under the `Assets` folder in the program. For some programs, the Marketo My Tokens are included in the Sales Nominated invite to make the email setup more efficient.

**Review the smartlist and schedule recurrence of email:**
* Smart List (filter):
    - Member of Program: (current program, registered status)
    - Not Was Sent Email: (one of previous emails for this event) in last 7 days
    - Subscription Filters (fitlers here are dependent on program type, and subject to change, so not adding all details)
* Flow
    - Send email: sales nominated email in the program
* Schedule
    - Choose `Schedule Recurrence`
    - Schedule: Daily
    - First Run: next relevant day to send (i.e. next business day available). Choose time of day relevant for timezone of event.
    - Repeat Every: Weekday (M-F)
    - End On: Day of the event

### Removing sales nominated scheduled deployment
{: #sales-nominated-remove-scheduled-deployment}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

You can remove specific recurrences of scheduled sales nominated deployments. The FMC is responsible for this change for field marketing activities, and campaign managers are responsible for this change for demand generation activities.

* Navigate to the `Schedule` tab of the Sales Nominated smart campaign
* Scroll down and you will see the scheduled deployment dates with a small red `x` to the right
* Click the small `x` next to any of the dates that you would like to remove from the scheduled deployments
