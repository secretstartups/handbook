## Mission

Provide Recommendations and Analysis to support and enable GitLab to be as efficient as possible with our cloud spend.

## Vision

The idea behind cloud cost management is to work in a cross-functional effort between many different departments including engineering, finance, and data to bring forth the best recommendations possible and prioritize these against all the other customer facing initiatives that are in development.

## Strategy

Our strategy follows a generic cost efficiency or data based framework where we have 5 stages of adoption related to cloud cost efficiency before we get to a stable point. Today we are somewhere between stages 1-4 depending on the problem area.

### Stage 1: Basic Cost Visibility

### Stage 2: Cost Allocation

### Stage 3: Optimize Usage Efficiency

### Stage 4: Measure Business Outcomes vs Spend

### Stage 5: Predict Future Spend & Problem Areas
