## Mission

The General Team supports the Reliability Team's [overall vision](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#vision) by supporting services for GitLab.com that do not fit the mission of the other [Reliability Teams](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams). See the [dedicated General Team Page](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/general.html) for more details.

## Vision

The General Team exists to ensure that all services at GitLab are properly supported by either providing that support directly or routing requests for new work to the appropriate [Reliability team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams) while also being the primary operators and maintainers of the GitLab.com application.  In the short-term, the goal is shrink the overall pool of what we call "General" by assigning ownership of services to appropriate [Reliability team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams) so that full attention can be paid to the processes, frameworks, architecture and automation required to properly support the GitLab.com application in the long term.

## Ownership and Responsibilities

### Services
The General Team is assigned issues based on the services they own.  This includes everything labeled `owner: reliability_general` in the [Service Catalog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/services/service-catalog.yml). 

#### Overlap
It is not always easy or possible to definitively determine the primary services associated with an issue, incident, or other piece of work.  When there is a lack of clarity, General Team members should collaborate with other Reliability Teams to determine the best path forward.  If necessary reach out to any Reliability Engineering Manager for assistance.

#### DBRE Support
The [DBRE team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/database-reliability.html) occasionally requires SRE support which the General Team, by default, will provide.

## How We Work - Prioritization
### Issues and Epics
Issues are prioritized utilizing the [Issue Management and Prioritization Process for Reliability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/issues.html).  The issues themselves are managed on The [General Team Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/boards/3993753?label_name%5B%5D=team%3A%3AGeneral).   This board is reviewed a minimum of once per week by the Engineering Manager for the General Team or by another member of the team if the Engineering Manager is not available.  

### OKRs
OKRs are established following the same process for [issue prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/issues.html).  In addition to OKRs, a variable percentage of team capacity is reserved each quarter for unplanned work (as the General Team will, by default, own any work that does not currently have a pre-defined owner).

### Corrective Actions and Security Issues

`~Severity::1`/`~Severity::2` Corrective Actions and `~reliability::P1`/`~reliability::P2` Security issues are, by default, prioritized over all other types work.

### Processes
#### Monthly Availability Updates

The General Team is responsible for ensuring the published Monthly Availability Updates are maintained.  This is currently a manual process.   Items to update include:

 1. [Historical Service Level Availability](/handbook/engineering/monitoring/#historical-service-level-availability) including [maintenance windows](https://status.gitlab.com/pages/history/5b36dc6502d06804c08349f7]) from the month in the comments
 2. [Executive Summary](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-quality/performance-indicators/#executive-summary)
 3. [GitLab.com Availability](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-quality/performance-indicators/#gitlabcom-availability) (Only last 3 months are required)

Each of these items should be updated to reflect the most recent month.  ([Sample MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/127806)).
 
Latest results are on the [GitLab.com General SLA Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-slas/general-slas?orgId=1&from=now-1M%2FM&to=now-1M%2FM) (internal only)
 
**Note**: Updates must be merged by the 7th day of each month.  This is currently a scheduled event on the Reliability General Team's Calendar.  Contact any member of the team for more details on this process.

#### Monthly Review of Incident and Pager Trends
The General team coordinates the monthly process to identify incident and pager trends across the engineering organization.  This is an async process with the following objectives:

 * Identify actions to address issues identified in the Reliability Team Monthly Availability Reports.
 * Generate action items based on the review of key metrics for incidents and pages.
 * Generate and delegate action items to the relevant teams based on the review process.  This includes:
    * [Corrective Actions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#corrective-actions)
    * [Infradev Issues](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#infradev)
    * [Reliability Improvement Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/new)
    
These efforts are coordinated asynchronously via the [GitLab Incident and Pager Trends Monthly Review Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBoyuKK_g3RbYMcwJZs6dFqCGH9NCqu-M3QsHIwiKMw/edit#)

The process is scheduled on the General Team Calendar to kick off on the first Tuesday of each month.

The DRI kicking off the process and ensuring its progress is rotated among members of the General Team.

All our welcome to participate in the process of identifying trends.  EOCs, especially, are encouraged to participate.
