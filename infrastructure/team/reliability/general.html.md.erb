## Mission

The General Team supports the Reliability Team's [overall vision](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#vision) by supporting services for GitLab.com that do not fit the mission of the other [Reliability Teams](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams). See the [dedicated General Team Page](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/general.html) for more details.

## Vision

The General Team exists to ensure that all services at GitLab are properly supported by either providing that support directly or routing requests for new work to the appropriate [Reliability team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams) while also being the primary operators and maintainers of the GitLab.com application.  In the short-term, the goal is shrink the overall pool of what we call "General" by assigning ownership of services to appropriate [Reliability team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams) so that full attention can be paid to the processes, frameworks, architecture and automation required to properly support the GitLab.com application in the long term.

## Ownership

### Services
The General Team is assigned issues based on the services they own.  This currently includes:

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Sidekiq | GitLab.com Application|
| API | GitLab.com Application |
| Snowplow | GitLab.com Application |
| PackageCloud | GitLab.com Application |
| Pages | GitLab.com Application |
| Git | GitLab.com Application |
| GitLab Rails | GitLab.com Application |
| Security-response | The General Team is responsible for coordinating the work for security issues that involve other services that are owned by the General Team.    |
| Infrastructure | This is a broad category to include any work <br> where a service label cannot be assigned or <br> created. |
| KAS | This service has no permanent team assigned |

#### Overlap
It is not always easy or possible to definitively determine the primary services associated with an issue, incident, or other piece of work.  When there is a lack of clarity, General Team members should collaborate with other Reliability Teams to determine the best path forward.  If necessary reach out to any Reliability Engineering Manager for assistance.

## How We Work - Prioritization
### Issues and Epics
Issues are prioritized utilizing the [Issue Management and Prioritization Process for Reliability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/issues.html).  The issues themselves are managed on The [General Team Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/boards/3993753?label_name%5B%5D=team%3A%3AGeneral).   This board is reviewed a minimum of once per week by the Engineering Manager for the General Team or by another member of the team if the Engineering Manager is not available.  

### OKRs
OKRs are established following the same process for [issue prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/issues.html).  In addition to OKRs, a variable percentage of team capacity is reserved each quarter for unplanned work (as the General Team will, by default, own any work that does not currently have a pre-defined owner).

### Corrective Actions and Security Issues

`~Severity::1`/`~Severity::2` Corrective Actions and `~reliability::P1`/`~reliability::P2` Security issues are, by default, prioritized over all other types work.
``By default,`~Severity::1`/`~Severity::2` Corrective Actions and `~reliability::P1`/`~reliability::P2` Security issues are prioritized over all other issue types.

### Processes
#### Monthly Availability Updates

The General Team is responsible for ensuring the published Monthly Availability Updates are maintained.  This is currently a manual process.   Items to update include:

 1. [Historical Service Level Availability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/monitoring/#historical-service-level-availability)
 2. [Executive Summary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#executive-summary)
 3. [GitLab.com Availability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#gitlabcom-availability)

Each of these items should be updated to reflect the most recent month.  ([Sample MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/120675)).
 
Latest results are on the [GitLab.com General SLA Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-slas/general-slas?orgId=1&from=now-1M%2FM&to=now-1M%2FM) (internal only)
 
**Note**: Updates must be merged by the 7th day of each month.  This is currently a scheduled event on the Reliability General Team's Calendar.  Contact any member of the team for more details on this process.

## Team Status Updates
The General Team provides weekly updates all Epics following the [Reliability Process for Epics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/issues.html#epics).  Epic updates are automatically reflected in the [GitLab SaaS Reliability Work Queue epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/898).

OKRs are updated every Wednesday as required by the [Reliability Process for OKR Updates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#okrs)

[Current OKRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=closed_at_desc&state=opened&type%5B%5D=objective&label_name%5B%5D=Reliability%3A%3AGeneral&first_page_size=100)
