In this section of the Channel Partner Programs Handbook we review assets and enablement from the perspective of GitLab Partners' Technical constituencies.

Beyond our Channel Partners Handbook pages, you will find sales guides, use cases, training materials, and program guides reviewed below and hosted and updated in our [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/). The materials should be a great place to start effectively selling, serving and hitting your number with GitLab.
