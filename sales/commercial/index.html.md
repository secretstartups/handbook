## Getting Started as a New Hire

Please ensure you read the [Commercial Sales onboarding page](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement/).

### Top Tips to Onboard Quicker

1. Bookmark the relevant SalesForce dashboard for your region, this is essential to your success. Your Manager will give you the link when you first join.
1. Get familiar with the [close date conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TK3X22rBPIOwR9PkopK4snmVVkyCyvdTwKJ_eszH48I/edit?usp=sharing) used in Commercial Sales.
1. Ensure you fully understand [the Required 7](/handbook/sales/commercial/#required-7). Your teammates and manager are more than happy to help you with this if you need it.
1. Read through reviews of GitLab to get an idea of what customers think about the product. Two good places to start are [Softwareadvice.com](https://www.softwareadvice.com/project-management/gitlab-profile/reviews/) and [Gartner Reviews](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/application-release-orchestration-solutions/vendor/gitlab/product/gitlab).
1. Watching videos is core to your onboarding. You can watch YouTube & Chorus videos at 1.5x or 1.75x speed to get through them efficiently, you can still retain the information but in less time. Go to the Settings widget > Playback speed.
1. When you first start, searching through Slack is a great way to find useful information as it's our primary method of asking questions and announcing things to the company. Some channels that are particularly good for information:
[#questions](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0AR2KW4B)
[#smb](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CH4KPGS87)
[#sales](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02NE5PQM)
[#smb_amer](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C010YDVD1BP)
[#international-smb](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CN84VB75H)
[#smb_training_support](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CKYLWKGJU)
[#competition](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C1BBL1V3K)
1. Use [BuiltWith.com](https://builtwith.com/) to get an idea of what technologies a customer is using currently (though be sure to verify this with them)
1. You might find it useful to create a Google doc to document all your learnings in your first 30 days, as you will get a lot of information to remember and it will also get you in the habit of taking notes, a [key part of GitLab’s culture](/handbook/communication/#external-communication).
1. You can never have too many [coffee chats](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats) with colleagues. You don’t need to ask permission from people, just put some time in their diary.
1. Make sure your calendar is always up to date so that you can get meetings from SDRs without having to moving them around.
1. Listen to as many [Chorus](https://chorus.ai/) calls as possible. They are an excellent way to onboard.
1. Add your own tips to this page as you onboard to pay it forward for the next new rep!

### Continuous Learning

Below is a list of resources considered highly valuable for continuous learning and development by Commercial Sales team members at GitLab. Note that some of these resources are not publicly available, so consult a fellow teammate for access where necessary.

- [GitLab Direction](/direction/#vision-1) Includes GitLab’s Vision, [Maturity](/direction/#maturity) framework and planned features and their release dates within each of GitLab’s [Paid Tiers](/direction/#paid-tiers).
- [GitLab Blog](/blog/) Monthly articles on Releases, Engineering, Open Source, Culture and other popular topics of interest.
- [GitLab Unfiltered YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) A YouTube channel private to GitLab employees with video recordings and playlists on company meetings, enablement sessions and other topics. Access GitLab's [Sales Enablement playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrirMKe3CyWl4ZBCKna5rJX).
- [Chorus Recordings](/handbook/business-ops/tech-stack/#chorus) Our team's history of call and demo recordings is a valuable training resource for new and existing sales team members.

- [Product Study Guide](/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/tiers/) A study course for team members to understand the current full scope of capabilities offered in each tier of GitLab and reasons for tier upgrades.
- [Sales Training](/handbook/sales/training/) page

### Events

When traveling please consider ROI of both any costs plus your time:
If you are going to an event you think first:

- What is the total you will spend for travel?
- What is the total you will spend on food and lodging for me?
- What is the amount you will likely spend on customer meals (meals x customers x # of times)?
- How many total business hours will you be away from salesforce?
- 8 hours: then you need to get 5x return on $, and the fact that any event pipeline closes at about 30%
- How many total personal life hours will you be away from your personal life?

Given the rough calculation above, you've to be committed driving/booking enough Net ARR at the event prior to you going to the event
Note: this doesn’t mean you can’t get travel approval without booking meetings. It means once you get travel approval it is on you to go get people to the event/meetings to create pipeline.

#### Trip Notes

The ultimate purpose of attending any GitLab field event is to gain insight and add value. Sid Sijbrandij, our CEO, talks about the importance of conferences and events [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ0CL3J08lI). He believes the main goal of GitLab team participation should always be to connect with our customers and prospects and not to solely attend presentations. Trip notes are our internal process for tracking and capturing this data.

#### Why and When?

Trip notes are required for the entire Commercial Sales Team anytime a team member travels for the company while working at GitLab. We believe it would be fun and valuable if you also shared trip notes when you traveled for personal reasons; however, that is up to your discretion.

#### How to properly document your trip notes?

Please follow the best practice process and use the [trip note template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B6EBhrzMhHynDUV6_K2qzuQqZ1jI_DfjCsUviJI_r_k/edit) as a format to prepare for your future trip.

#### Trip Notes Best Practice

1. Commercial attendee will write up their notes in a google doc.
1. Please save your notes as GitLab internal read only for Commercial Team review in the [Commercial Sales Drive Trip Notes Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e71aL5OP_QlaAHTmMNwAAqIUfc2aD6Dt).
1. Once saved, please slack and share a link to your notes in the commercial_global_all channel to alert the team of your recent trip.
1. Finally, please share your [Post Trip feedback](/handbook/marketing/events/#post-event) for the entire company and the Field Marketing team directly in the specific Event Issue on the ‘Post Event Recap & Feedback’ spreadsheet.

### Give Back Project

#### What is the Give Back Project?

- The Give Back Project is a self-selected opportunity to help the Commercial Sales team achieve better results. It is a finite project that, upon completion, is to be adopted by no less than 70% of the Commercial Sales team and used at least once a month.
- The Give Back Project is assigned to all new Commercial Sales team members and is required to be completed as part of their on-boarding process.

#### Why is there a Give Back Project?

- The goal of the Give Back Project is to allow new team members to be able to instantly contribute to the Commercial Sales team
- Fosters GitLab’s values of collaboration and results
- The Give Back Project gives team members the opportunity to be exposed to problems on the team today and will allow the team to look back and see how we addressed shortcomings in the past

#### How does the Give Back Project differ from the Center of Excellence?

- The COE is assigned while the Give Back is self-selected
- During team QBRs in February 2019, it was determined that there were certain aspects that made selling at GitLab difficult. Those aspects were divided into categories and those categories were assigned to different team members to become experts at, forming the Center of Excellence
- The COE has already been determined by the team as areas where the team needs improvements while the value of a team member’s Give Back Project needs to be realized
- A Give Back Project can be working on a portion of the COE

#### How to properly document a Give Back Project

- Give Back Projects are described and worked by team members in the [Commercial Sales issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/commercial-sales/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Give+Back+Project)
- If it is something that needs to be repeated (like a customer AMA) an associated handbook entry is created with a description on how a new person could achieve this
- Although the Give Back Project is designed to be finite, there is always room for iteration at GitLab. Be sure to include any necessary instructions on how a different team member would be able to add to your project if necessary

#### Example Give Back Projects

**Customer AMAs:** Meetings for GitLab team members with current customers that provide an opportunity to ask them about anything in regard to their experience with GitLab

**Customer Meetings:** Sharing the best practices for conducting any kind of external meeting at GitLab

**Trip Notes:** allows team members who attend field events to track and capture data in order for the rest of the team to gain insight

**Doing Business with Partners/Channels:** Guidelines on how to work with partners and resellers in order to ensure value is maximized in these areas

**How to Handle New Customers After They Purchase:** Best practices for handling new GitLab customers based on the scope of their purchase

**Technical Evaluation of Customers:** How to properly evaluate a customer’s current technical environment in order to create organizational alignment and prescribe how GitLab can best solve their problems

## Required 7

New team members should familiarize themselves with [The Required 7](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement/required7/). These are the 7 tactical skills required to be an excellent Commercial Sales Account Executive:

1. [Ranking your accounts](/handbook/sales/commercial/#account-ranking) - [video here](https://youtu.be/M-5OhlYxmFI)
    - Rank all accounts and explain why; log your sources for future efficiency; this needs to be your (recent) ranking, not the previous owners, nor the ranking from the prior fiscal. If it’s unchanged, make the note that it is unchanged and why
1. Building your [custom deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1duy8kjEvNiRx8fnCvc6ZnxWwXTM_71phbG3k9rgmU4Q/edit?usp=sharing) for any opp amount over $5k SMB $10k MM **Amount** (n.b. amount, not Net ARR) that:
    - Calculates the ROI of using GitLab vs. next best option (this might be vs. do nothing)
    - Provides the 2 options for the customer going forward - normally both with GitLab (example: Ult or Prem)
    - Demonstrates a customised vision for the customer: “what if you used all of GitLab to do Devops in a single app?”
    - Capture the full response, in the customers’ words to that vision and the reasons why they think it is possible, or not possible. This capture can be done in the speaker notes so your customer can validate and then copied into an activity after the call.
    - [video here](https://youtu.be/9Yq23PijO3c), and be sure to check out [this video](https://youtu.be/QDoXhDvkDYY) on creating an effective ROI slide deck and [this supporting deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1otCJF4kaaozhp0qWD3VgGQ73WgX1ZNP_IKnu3Qt_slI/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Capturing key information:
    - How did the customer/prospect hear about GitLab and what is their understanding of what we do?
    - Meaningful information on why we won/lost a deal
1. Logging your [call notes](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement/#sales-note-taking) [video on taking efficient notes during a meeting](https://youtu.be/CMMQ5R0pq8I) and top tips from a top performer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKRvxM2F5zc)
1. [Updating your next steps](/handbook/sales/commercial/#opportunity-next-steps-best-practices) - [video here](https://youtu.be/74OKSNWoN8Q)
1. [Command plans](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/command-plan/), what needs to be filled in:
    - $5k SMB, $10k MM **Amount** - All fields in opportunity overview (the whys) and close-plan over this Amount threshold
    - $10k SMB, $20k MM **Net ARR** - Full Command Plan over this Net ARR threshold
    - If you don’t yet know the answers or have the data, you will populate the Command Plan fields with your script and next steps to get that information
    - Exception to command plan: for channel managed opportunities we may not have access - put `Channel-Managed` in the opportunity title
    - ([training session here](https://youtu.be/zN_0J6syxmM) and [training deck here](https://bit.ly/2WNlzbZ))
1. Keeping your opportunities [up to date at all times](/handbook/sales/commercial/#salesforce-pipeline-activity) [video](https://youtu.be/o5gm7_5321w)

## Chorus recordings
A recording Chorus license is mandatory for all Commercial Account Executives. Our intent is to record customer calls for the following reasons:

- For training, to make sure we are giving customers the best possible experience 
- To give to the customer as a visual record of our conversations with them
- To verify any details we may have missed in the conversation

### Mandatory steps required to record calls
Laws around recording differ from states to state and country to country. Therefore, it is required that every Account Executive take the steps below on *every* customer call. The Account Executive is responsible for ensuring the steps below are followed.

1. Introduce GitLab Notetaker and clearly explain what it is and why it is there. Example: "You may have noticed GitLab Notetaker here. This is recording the call for training and verification. I can share the recording with you if you want. If you are OK being recorded, please say so verbally and give a thumbs up. If you're not, I can remove it from the meeting."
2. If the customer requests that they are not recorded, you must remove GitLab Notetaker immediately and verbally confirm you have done so.
3. If the customer verbally and visually agrees to being recorded, you can continue.
4. If you are due to be on a call and cannot make it, you **must** inform the customer that Chorus will be in the call and that they should remove Notetaker when you decline the invite.

Failure to follow the above is not acceptable in any situation. 

## [Opportunity Consults](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/opportunity-consults/) (OCF) and Lightweight Deal Review (LDR) Process

#### SMB

- An Opportunity Consult happens when the opportunity Net ARR threshold is $10K +
- A Light Weight Deal Review happens when the opportunity Net ARR threshold is $5K and is forecasted to close this month or next month.

#### Mid-Market

- An Opportunity Consult happens when the opportunity Net ARR threshold is $20K +
- A Light Weight Deal Review happens when the opportunity Net ARR threshold is $10K and is forecasted to close this month or next month.

### Opportunity Next Steps Best Practices

1. Always keep Next Steps Date and Next Steps up to date as an assignment to a future version of yourself on how you will take action to continue the customers buying process.
1. When you start your day you need to check all inputs like email, zendesk, and lead queue so you can triage those requests into your priorities for that day.
1. Allocate times of your day in four ways:

   - Customer meetings scheduled
   - Proactive email and internal efforts
   - Proactive calling efforts
   - Time to check inputs again

1. When beginning a proactive time block, open your opportunities view and sort by Next Steps Date.
1. Your Next Steps should be specific and compelling so that you can take action on them within 3 minutes of reading.
    1. `Next Steps` should contain **_only_** the actions you will take next: no dates, no history, just the Next Steps
    2. When you update `Next Steps`, the `Next Steps History` will automatically capture your prior `Next Steps`, applying a date stamp and storing them in reverse-chronological order
    3. __Please Note:__ If you previously included history in the `Next Steps` field, the next time you update `Next Steps` you will need to clear the field completely and input only your Next Steps

### Opportunity-Specific Slide Deck

It is required that all opportunities above $10,000 (Mid Market) and $5,000 (SMB) in total amount (not Net ARR) will have a custom slide deck that is shared with the customer or prospect. The custom deck must be attached to the opportunity by pasting the deck link in the SalesForce field 'Link to Custom Pitch Deck' on the opportunity home page. This will enable Mid Market Account Executives and SMB Account Executives to capture critical account information. Additionally, this will facilitate selling on value rather than features.

#### Custom Deck Requirements

1. **Visual Requirements**

   - Deck's main color will match or resemble that of the customer's.
   - Where possible, use the customer's logo.
   - It is appropriate to ask the customer for a blank template.

1. **Customer Agreed-upon Agenda**

   - When meeting with the customer, leverage an agreed upon agenda to aide in co-selling.

1. **Calculated ROI of GitLab v. Next Best Option**

   - For New Business the next best option could be 'do nothing' or our competition.
  - For Renewals the next best option could be to go back to what they were doing before.

1. **Two options (rough plans) with GitLab going forward**

   - For new business this takes the form of [Two Lane Selling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7DCIRAQ1pRiqDF6Aebl354uoMXiXbSVLaC_XefzM6w/edit) where we give them a high engagement and a low engagement option.
   - For a renewal, this could be a one year v. a three year option, or Premium v. Ultimate.

1. **Non-Custom Single Application pitch to the customer**

   - This slide should have a visual representation of using GitLab as a single application for the entire software development life cycle.
   - The intent of this slide is to have the conversation with the customer on 'what is possible', and to capture their feedback

1. **Full capture of the customer's feedback on the 'Single Application' slide**

   - Capture the customer's actual words in the speaker notes of the 'single application' slide

## SMB Account Executives

SMB Account Executives "SMB AEs" act as Account Executives and the face of GitLab for [SMB](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#segmentation) prospects and customers. They are the primary point of contact for companies that employ between 1 to 99 employees. These GitLab team members are responsible for working new business in their [territory](/handbook/sales/territories) as well as handling the customer journey for new and existing customers. SMB Account Executives will assist prospects through their evaluation and buying process and will be the customer's point of contact for any renewal and expansion discussions. [Please read through the SMB handbook page for more information](/handbook/sales/commercial/smb).

- [Troubleshooting Resource for Licensing/Subscription Management](/handbook/sales/commercial/#troubleshooting--how-to-resources-for-licensing--subscription-management)
- [Quotes / Sales Order Processing](/handbook/sales/commercial/#quotes--sales-order-processing)

### Inbound Queue Management

**Zendesk:** Managing incoming requests received through support.gitlab.com

**The goal and focus** of working Zendesk tickets for the SMB team is to help with **upselling** and **renewals**

Within timezone (WIP), the Support team is responsible to take the lead on all incoming ZD tickets in the [Upgrades, Renewals, and AR (refunds) queue](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/filters/360034975053). In off-hours, the SMB team will triage and handle any tickets which will breach during their timezone.

Support will take the lead on all incoming requests in the queue and only forward to the sales owner when:

- There is an Net ARR affecting event from a **customer** -OR-
- There is a credit or other request which requires sales manager approval

### Salesforce Pipeline Activity

#### Opportunity Management in Salesforce

- Prior to working a new opportunity always double-check the Account segmentation is "SMB" and the employee count for the company is less than 100, by viewing datafox information and verifying with LinkedIn (especially outside of AMER)
- Direct yourself every day to your Next Steps to know how to prioritize and organize your day. Recommendations on how to work through your next steps for the day:
1. Sort by stage, placing highest priority stage at the top
1. Prioritize the opportunities you are going to work on first by stage, amount, and close date
1. Ensure "Next Steps," "Next Step Date," and "Next Steps Owner" are current with actionable and informative information that helps guide you on how to move the opportunity through the pipeline
1. If a potential future opportunity that requires an action is greater than 30 days out, make sure this is detailed in the next steps field
1. Once opportunities in the stages Discovery through Awaiting Signature are updated, begin working on Pending Acceptance. Continue to prioritize with the same criteria as above.

#### Pipeline Generation
- In weekly communication with your direct management review the health of your pipeline and update records as needed in real-time. You should know at all times what your pipeline multiplier is and if you need to create more pipeline to have a successful month and quarter. Refer to your team's **Pipeline Generation** checklist documents and the associated SFDC reports associated with keeping activity up to date. 

#### Web Direct Oppty Management in Salesforce

- Find the report view for all CFQ "current fiscal quarter" Web Direct purchases in your territory "SMB_Web Directs CFQ _name":

1. Check that there are no open opportunities that could have been a duplicate by viewing the opportunities listed under the Account
1. If not a duplicate, place the main contact in the opportunity on the outreach sequence "SMB_Web Direct Outreach" - by: Madeline Hennessy
1. Dependent on the opportunity and company if personal outreach is preferred, you must log your activity and have a next step date to follow up on your activity

#### Licensing/Subscription Management

> Note: if you need access to a system, [open an Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request)

License Key Management for On-Premise Trials & Subscriptions

- Access [the LicenseApp](https://license.gitlab.com/) to resend or provide changes to a license key or trial evaluation

GitLab.com Trials & Subscription Management

- Access [the CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer) to provide changes to a user, group, or subscription.

#### Close Date Conventions

<span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">First, forecasting, down to even the opportunity level, is a routine exercise for accuracy, not motivation or aspiration. Each week on Wednesday it is required to update five values in Clari by close of business (5 PM) local time.  This is Renewal Loss Best Case, Renewal Loss Best Case, Gross Net ARR Best Case, Gross Net ARR Commit, and Net 50/50.  At this time, it is required to double-check pipeline cleanliness and always follow the close date conventions listed here.</span>

1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The close date should always be in the month that you believe it has the most likely chance of closing (with only one exception as dictated below).</span>
1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At **all times** the Net ARR amount should reflect your best estimate of the actual amount that the opportunity will have on it when it closes in the month reflected in the close date. There are no exceptions other than returning from an onsite visit, even if you have not spoken with the account. If you get a new opp you should quickly assess the account and, given your experience, make an educated guess on what amount the company will transact at.</span>
1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Stage represents where you believe the customer is in their buying process, not only the specific steps they have taken with you.</span>

<span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The three close dates:</span>

1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Last day of the month it will close in **only if you have a compelling event defined**</span>
1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The actual day the opportunity will close when the quote goes out for signature. It will appear past due if we don’t get the signature back and pushes to the Friday of the week it should close.  Renewals default to this convention</span>
1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">First day of the following month, no compelling event defined </span>
    1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is to straddle the first two and we have a plan to get a compelling event, then move to the last day of the month of actual closing</span>
    1. <span class="colour" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This close date carries a window of roughly 60 days of when you think it will come in</span>

**Example**: It's April 23rd, a new business Mid-Market opportunity is identified for a company at 410 employees and growing at an unknown rate (unclear due to being an agency). The company completed their evaluation with a trial ending this month, there are defined problems initially trying to solve, with some people who have used GitLab before.

- Question for AE and self, what % chance of the purchase occurring in April, May, or June?
    - 90% April, 10% May

## Mid Market Account Executive

Midmarket Account Executives are the primary point of contact between prospective and existing customers of GitLab within a space defined as mid-market, which currently works with companies that employ between 100 to 1,999 employees. These GitLab team members manage the spectrum of project sizes, ranging from small fast growing teams in smaller agile organizations to complex enterprise projects advising on the journey with GitLab to achieve specific business outcomes.

Mid-Market AEs work closely in tandem with the business development team and sales management to manage a broad book of business spread over a large opportunity value range and focus on exceeding client expectations.

### Mid Market Roles

1. **MM Key Accounts First Order AE** (MMKAFO): These AEs work on the highest potential accounts that are not currently customers of GitLab. Once the customer has signed its first contract, the customer is transitioned to a MM Key Account Named AE. However, if an account is won by this team and is deemed to be low potential it will be passed to a MM Territory AE. The rough guideline for these accounts is more than 500 employees total and more than 100 combined employees in engineering and IT. We don't refer to MM First Order accounts as "Named Accounts", because First Order accounts can either go to Named or Territory AEs.

1. **MM Key Accounts Named AE** (MMKAN): These AEs work on current customers that have been deemed to be high spending (high CARR) or have the potential to be high spending (high LAM). To be successful the MMKAN AE must expand their accounts more than the standard expansion rate for their named list of accounts. The named list for each MMKAN AE will grow through the fiscal year as the MMKAFO AE wins new high potential customers.

1. **MM Territory AE**: These AEs work geographic regions of accounts that have not been vetted to be MM Key Account First Order AE or MM Key Account named AE. The role sells to both prospects and current accounts.

"MM Key Accounts" can be used to refer to MM Key Accounts First Order and MM Key Accounts Named collectively. MM Key Accounts are the sub-set of MM accounts with a higher [LAM](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#landed-addressable-market-lam) and potential LAM.

### Core Responsibilities

- Own your set of accounts - build & execute your plan.
- Manage book of business: new business, expansion, renewals.
- Collaborate with Sales Development channel for handover of inbound qualified opportunities to progress to closure.
- Execute outbound campaigns.

#### New Business

- Work Initial Qualification Meetings [IQM's](/handbook/sales/commercial/#inbound-queue-management) from SDR Team
- Accept Sales Accepted Opportunities according to [SAO Criteria](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#criteria-for-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao)
- Nurture and help prospects during their Trial evaluation after Accepting Opportunities
- Push to Webdirect or help with the Sales Order Process

#### Selecting Target Accounts for marketing

- Log into Datafox or Sales Navigator
- Input your territory criteria
- Establish a list of accounts and sort by Company Head Count
- Search for keywords like DevOps
- Look into each account to see if they are actually yours

## Account Ownership Rules of Engagement for Commercial Sales

It's expected from the Commercial Sales Team to follow the [Account Ownership Rules of Engagement](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/)
This section provides step by step clarity on how to follow the **ROE**.

### Process to follow:

1. Check **Datafox** data - wholly wrong? Go to step 2
1. Check **Zoominfo** data - wholly wrong? Go to step 3
1. Check **LinkedIn** Data - wholly wrong?
1. Search for **3rd party resources** which provide SMB/MM segment prove (only needed when 1 of the above resources do not provide leading data to go with)
1. Paste the source and the gaps all found that led you to it in Chatter on the `Account level` and **cc VP Commercial Sales** to review
1. VP of Commercial Sales will provide the leading decision

**Note:**

- **Priority order:** only go to the next source IF the data number is wholly wrong / inaccurate
- **REQUIRED:** `Never` ask the customer/prospect to provide information on the company size
- **Currently:** Leading decision will be based on the fact if the Account was SMB/MM segment during the **Feb 2019 size clean up**
- **From Q4 on** - Leading decision will be based on the fact if Account was SMB/MM segment based on the **Nov 2019 size clean up**

## Account Ranking

It is a requirement for the Commercial Sales Team to tier their accounts using the fields on the Account Object. This helps prioritize the accounts to go after when prospecting for new or expansion. Please see below definitions specific to SMB and Mid-Market AEs.

### Ranking Training and Definitions

[Commercial Sales: Account Ranking Training Clippet](https://youtu.be/M-5OhlYxmFI)

#### Small Business Account Executive Definitions for Account Ranking

- Rank 1: Top 10 Accounts with new business or upselling possibility within the next 12 months
- Rank 1.5: Future opportunities that we should not lose track of as there is a sales opportunity here with no timeline
- Rank 2: Believe there is an opportunity, but will take additional work before opening and beginning a sales cycle
- Rank 3: Greenfield, SDR attention - perhaps a drip campaign
- SMB AE must have potential user field filled in on the account object for Rank 1, and 1.5
- SMB AE must have the notes section filled in on why an account is Rank 2 or 3

#### Mid-Market Account Executive Definitions for Account Ranking

- Rank 1: Accounts that I am working to maximize their Net ARR this fiscal year.
- Rank 1.5 The subset of Rank 2 that is best and trending toward being future Rank 1s.
- Rank 2 Accounts that I am working to grow and I speak with them at least once a month.
- Rank 3 Accounts that I keep informed about GitLab and DevOps monthly.

## Co-Selling
Co-selling is the responsibility of both the Account Executive and their Area Sales Manager to join sales calls together. This is to ensure the best client/prospect experience, along with jointly finding the highest potential within that account. 
Area Sales Managers have an expectation to log a minimum of 5 co-selling calls per rolling 7 days, although we are aiming to achieve closer to 10-12 calls over a rolling 7 days.

### Co-Selling Roles when working with your ASM
* Primary Seller: Consider this role as the main pitch person. You are directing the conversation, sharing the deck and taking live notes and adding value, while also keeping on track with the agenda decided upon.
* Co-Seller: This individual is responsible for raw notes in Salesforce, time management, and digging into comments to identify areas where we should be finding additional information. The Co-pilot should be digging into levels and amounts of pain when the Pilot moves on without capturing this.

### Working with Channel Partners

The GitLab partner network is ready to work with GitLab Account Executive's in order to extend the customer selling and services capacity offered by Commercial Sales. Channel's approach to this is called Partner Co-selling and working with Partners involves building a simple, clear, mutual customer opportunity plan establishing “who will do what, when?”. 

#### What are the key benefits from working with partners? 

*   AEs Working with Partners for Increased Customer Value & Net ARR
*   Extended reach and capabilities via Partner sales and services capacity and reach via  GitLab-trained Partner AE’s, SA’s, Engineers, and often a GitLab channel manager to coordinate/assist.   
*   Accelerated reach to new customer logos “**_Land_**”: Partners are beginning to bring GitLab new logo opportunities via mining their customer base. In many cases, Partners already have a “trusted Partner status” with their customers, which also serves to accelerate new logo engagements. 
*   Increased customer “**_Expand_**” success: In many cases, Partners will sell and deliver the key services called for to ensure customers get the maximum value from their GitLab technology investment and drive stage advance along with user growth.  
*   Deployment and related services: For faster delivery and increased capacity, AEs are turning to Partners to sell and deliver these services, also TAM-like customer success services. 
*   In the case of OPEN partners via distributors, dramatic reduction in the admin steps associated with quote-to-order process.

#### How do AEs work with partners for increased customer value & Net ARR? 

GitLab has a mature Partner network with good coverage of GitLab-trained Sales and Technical resources.  There are a few ways in which AEs will work with a customer including a Partner. 

*   [Approved Partner GitLab Deal Registrations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/#the-deal-registration-program-overview) As these are received in your territory, in most cases* you will be contacted by a GitLab channel team member to arrange a co-selling kickoff call to develop a simple Partner co-selling plan to share with the Partner.  GitLab Channel Managers do not proactively manage all OPEN Partners. AEs can always request Channel Manager support for a Deal Registration by slacking channel-sales or available contacts.
*  If you find themselves thinking 1. “a Partner SA could execute on this  customer-requested SA task”, or 2. AEs have customers that could benefit from a “Partner services attach engagement”, reach out on slack [#channel-sales](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CT9KKE5RR) with a Partner engagement request, if possible with a link to the related account or opportunity. A member of the channel team will promptly reach out to learn more about the request, and connect you with a Partner that is pre-qualified to promptly and properly execute on the task at hand, and keep you updated along the way. 
*   AEs should lead planning and execution of the joint opportunity/customer pursuit with alignment and support of the partner and GitLab Channel Manager. The plan should be [tracked in SFDC with tasks and action items](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/channel/#partner-co-selling-best-practices-and-how-partners-can-help-with-r7-and-command-plans). Partners should always get an email confirmation of any tasks assigned to them (via AE or Channel Mgr).  
*   Channel Managers will engage with AE’s in the following ways:
    *   When a new deal registration arrives in the AE’s pipeline
    *   To review 2-3 Partners for the AE to work with for AE-selected joint customer success motions:
        *   The Channel Manager will bring the possibilities forward during this call
        *   2 examples of working with Partners are featured in this **[this Levelup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndrNX8fIIqs&list=PL05JrBw4t0KrirMKe3CyWl4ZBCKna5rJX&index=2)**
        *   AEs should share their thoughts about prioritizing which Partner activities would be best for which of their customers
* In the case of Open partners via distributions, when the opportunity is ready, AE's email `partnersupport@gitlab.com` with the link to the opportunity requesting quote-to-order support (chatter alias coming soon) 

#### Resources to learn more about teaming with Channel Partners?

*   If this is a first time for an AE, we recommend watching the available training delivered. This Levelup video starts with a basic understanding of the [Channel Partner landscape](https://youtu.be/OeykHQetd7U). 
*   LevelUp video on [Maximizing Value of Partners in a Deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndrNX8fIIqs&list=PL05JrBw4t0KrirMKe3CyWl4ZBCKna5rJX&index=2) specifically for AE’s to learn more about co-selling success.
*   [Learn more about Partner co-selling best practices,  how Partners can help build out key elements of an AE’s R7 & Command Plans ](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/channel/#partner-co-selling-best-practices-and-how-partners-can-help-with-r7-and-command-plans)and much more in the [Channel Sales Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/channel/). 
*   Slack [#channel-sales](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CT9KKE5RR) or reach out to your Channel Account Manager with any questions or requests for assistance. The channel is closely monitored by several members of the channel team who are here to help AE’s succeed in co-selling in any way we can.

## Mid-Market Key Accounts First Order

**Mid-Market Key Accounts First Order Team (MMKAFO) Tactics and Definitions**


[The MM Key Accounts First Order Team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/commercial/#mid-market-roles) is comprised of Account Executives that work on the highest potential accounts that are [not currently customers of GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#first-order-customers). Once the customer has signed its first contract, the customer is transitioned to a MM Key Account Named AE. However, if an account is won by this team and is deemed to be low potential it will be passed to a MM Territory AE. The rough guideline for these accounts is between 500 and 1999 employees and more than 100 combined employees in engineering and IT. We don't refer to MM First Order accounts as "Named Accounts", because First Order accounts can either go to Named or Territory AEs.

It is the goal of this team to make the first transaction with GitLab:
1.  Customer-Focused
2.  Efficient
3.  Scaleable

#### First Order Prospecting Guidelines

**Inbound Leads**
 1. As a general rule, Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) own leads and Account Executives (AEs) own accounts and opportunities. It is the Account Executive's job to help the SDR understand how the First Order team works and what the expectations are. The expectations are as follows:
   - Reach out to all [Marketing Qualified Leads](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#:~:text=The%20lead%20scoring%20model%20is,Score%20and%20their%20Demographic%20Score%20.) (MQLs) within one hour of them being assigned to the SDR.
    - The first outreach should be a phone call if there is a phone number listed
    - After the initial call, the SDR should email the prospect using either the sequence designated for trial requests and contact requests or the sequence designated for all other MQLs.
    - If an MQL or inquiry hasn't been actioned after two weeks of being assigned to the SDR, the AE has permission to reach out to the lead.


#### First Order Handoff Process

After the first transaction is closed by the MMKAFO team, the First Order AEs are responsible to kickstart the handover process. Below are the responsibilities of the Mid-Market Key Account First Order team and the Mid-Market Key Account Named team.

**MMKAFO Team**
1. After the opportunity is marked 'Closed-Won', [look here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/2028) to find the appropriate MMKAN AE.
2. Ensure the customer has received and installed their license
3. Chatter the Named AE (if known), their ASM, the First Order ASM, Sales-Support, and Mid-Market Global Director to change the account and renewal opportunity into the Named Account Executive’s name.
4. Log an activity on the ACCOUNT detailing: 
    -  Why the account chose GitLab (use case)
    -  Key contacts at the account
    -  The expected NetARR to be sold in the next 12 months
    -  Date by which the next order is expected to close
    -  Estimated NetARR of the next opportunity
    -  Why you believe c,d,and e
    -  Naming convention of the activity should be: (Name of FO AE) FO Account Summary for Handoff
5. Set up a call with the Named AE and the customer for a handoff call. 
6. If the initial amount AND the immediate potential of the account is low (< $20,000 
combined), a handoff email can be used.
7. Ensure all material like custom decks are editable by everyone.

**MMKAN Team**
1. Work with the First Order AE to schedule a handoff call (or email) with the customer.
    - The goal should be to have two-way communication with the customer within one week of the initial close.
    - Named AE please respond to the handoff email/meeting invite to introduce yourself.
2. Look in the account activities for the notes from the First Order AE, and based on those notes open an appropriate growth opportunity.
3. Read through all notes tagged (ii) to gain an understanding of the account and its potential.
4. Determine if a TAM (if under $50,000 nARR) is appropriate for this customer based on the immediate growth potential. If needed, request on
5. Create a growth/add on opportunity for any growth that will happen before the first renewal date.

**Note 1:** Once the account is handed off to the new AE, the new account owner is responsible for the success of the account. This includes any troubleshooting, support, ticket escalations, etc. The exception to this will be if there are any billing issues that arise on the initial order. Because billing issues related to the first order are assigned to the account owner. In some cases, the First Order AE can better fix such problems. In these cases, Named AE can re-assign the issue to the First Order AE for resolution.

**Note 2:** If a First Order account is deemed to have low potential (fewer than 100 total users), it should be assigned to a Mid-Market Territory Account Executive. If in question, the First Order AE should involve their ASM, Regional Director, and VP of Commercial to determine if the account should be assigned to a Mid-Market First Order AE or a Mid-Market Named AE.
