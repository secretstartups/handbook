Small and Medium Size Business Account Executives "SMB AE" act as Account Executives and the face of GitLab for SMB prospects and customers. They are the primary point of contact for companies that employ between [1 to 99 employees](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/). These GitLab team members are responsible for working new business in their territory as well as handling the customer journey for new and existing customers. SMB Account Executives will assist prospects through their GitLab evaluation and buying process and will be the customer's point of contact for any renewal and expansion discussions.

### Onboarding

The goal of [onboarding](/handbook/sales/commercial/enablement) in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running. Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of the GitLab culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.

### Required 7

All team members from Commercial Sales are expected to implement the [Required 7](/handbook/sales/commercial/#required-7) into their sales process. None of the 7 should be missing at any time. The Required 7 will help to stay on top of your territory, deliver what is promised to the prospect / customer and have quality meetings.

### SMB Processes

#### Territories and Account Owners

Overview of the divided territories and owners for `SMB segment`. This territory page also shows Account owners for the other segments (`Mid Market` and `Strategic`)

- [EMEA](/handbook/sales/territories/)
- [AMER](/handbook/sales/territories/)
- [APAC](/handbook/sales/territories/)
- Follow the [rules of engagement (ROE)](/handbook/sales/commercial/#account-ownership-rules-of-engagement-for-commercial-sales) when an account is wrongly routed into your name

#### Team Dashboards

These Dasboards are used to keep track on team performance globally as well as per region.

- [Global](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000skkt)
- [EMEA & APAC](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oWy)
- [NORAM](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000slTA)

#### Call Preps

Though not mandatory, call preps are a great way to gain a different perspective on your opportunities during a sales cycle. Thus, allowing you to be more prepared for following meetings.

- Put time on the calendar to connect with a fellow SMB team member or someone else of choice (Solution Architect, Technical Account Manager, Area Sales Manager)
- Be prepared with the Salesforce link to the opportunity, as well as your deck/call notes if applicable
- During or after the Call Prep, **log an activity** on the opportunity labeled `Prep w/ [team member name]`.

#### Qualification Calls

One initiative as an SMB AE is to be connecting with as many current customers as possible to support them in finding ways to utilize more of GitLab. Every time you hold a call with a client to discuss entering into a sales cycle for either uptiering, or increasing user count please include "qual" or "qualification" into the subject line of your logged activity. We should also be submitting "qual" or "qualification during our first IQM (Initial Qualifying Meeting) with all prospects.

#### True Ups

True-ups are conversations that often come to the table with customers during renewal conversations. It's important to get yourself familiar with the term, how true-ups work - and how the SMB team is handling true-up conversations:

- If you still have questions about a specific true up case, please write in the [`#smb_training_support`](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CKYLWKGJU) channel for further assistance

### Solutions Architect & Technical Account Manager Rules of Engagement

- Follow the [Commercial Sales standards](/handbook/customer-success/comm-sales/#additional-engagement-guidelines-for-sales) for engaging a Technical Account Manager or Solution Architect into the conversation with a customer or prospect.
- If limited on resources, encourage clients to submit questions to the following communities:
    - Community Forum: https://forum.gitlab.com/
    - Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/

#### Renewals & Account Management (WIP)

For suggested email templates for a mid-term call along with renewal calls, reference the latest in the **SMB Email Templates** shared document.

#### Discount Approval Process (WIP)

#### Forecasting (WIP)

Please use the following analysis of your pipeline to get the most accurate monthly and quarterly forecast

1. Find your total Closed Won "CW" pipeline
1. Find the iACV in your Current Active pipeline. Forecast this bucket by weighted amounts (it can be weighted by each stage to be micro, or an average weight based on your close ratio). Manual work is taken into account here. You may have top value deals that need to be adjusted, closing at 100% for best case, or maybe 0-low x% worst case/commit.
1. The next important number is your expected pipeline growth. On average how much pipeline do you create and close each week. As months (or quarters) continue does the close rate decrease or increase. Typically it decreases therefore the average amount created+closed per day as the month (or quarter) continues goes down and then restarts day 1 of the next month (or quarter)
1. Finally, use the following equations to get your 50/50, best case, and commit number to forecast. This is all using Gross iACV as the renewal loss will be automatically calculated into this equation based on the input in Clari

- CW + (Active * x%) + (Growth * x%) = 50/50
- CW + ((active - top deals)* x% + top deals at 90-100%) + (Growth * x%) = best case
- CW + ((active - top deals)* x% + top deals at 0-20%) + (Growth * x%) = commit/low

1. Things to consider

- Deals in next month that can pull into this month go into best case
- Deals this month that can push to next month take out of commit
- If you are earlier in the quarter you (growth *x%) is higher growth and higher % than end of month
- How many blue birds do you get per quarter - have you had one this quarter? It can weigh the (growth *x%) to one extreme or another unexpectedly

**Meeting etiquette**

1. Be Respectful, though challenging
1. Be confrontational, though constructive

### Resources

- [Recommended books for SMB team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KOw5A84uUvKLBI9zdspbGpP4t3OOqsQLLKj6eTBjFw/edit)
- [International G-drive with recordings of team meetings / trainings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ADQKNz5y48VuUk9PVA)

### Compensation

- The global SMB team is measured monthly on shared [quota](/handbook/sales/commissions/) attainment. All [iACV](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice) goes toward the global _shared quota_ retirement.
- The global SMB team is paid on [gross IACV](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/).
- Because SMB AEs operate as individual contributors toward a shared quota, [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) is key. One teammate's success is everyone's success.

#### [Payment Schedule](/handbook/finance/payroll/#pay-date):

- AMER: [commissions](/handbook/sales/commissions/) based on prior month attainment are paid on the 2nd payroll cycle the following month.
- EMEA & APAC: commission payout dates are specific to the country of residency.
- you can find your adjusted payout statement and submit inquiries via [CaptivateIQ](https://www.captivateiq.com/).

Any further questions related to SMB Compensation can be directed to the slack channel #total-rewards or your direct manager.

### Handbook Mantra

GitLab is intentional about documenting in a manner that creates a single source of truth. [It operates handbook-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/), and in valuing transparency, makes its handbook publicly accessible to all. SMB team members should always be striving to contribute and exemplify this value.
