1. 3-4 updates from GitLab, usually helpful content or big announcements 
1. All release details from the [GitLab Releases page.](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/)

### Process
1. Email is sent out by 9 am CT on the 22nd (or first business day) of each month
   1. Sent to sales-all and SDR email groups
   1. Reminder in #sales-all Slack channel
