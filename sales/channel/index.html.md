# GitLab Channel Overview

Although we welcome all partners, our program is structured to provide additional rewards for partners that make a commitment and investments in a deeper GitLab relationship.

### Channel Value for GitLab

The Channel is a critical part of our overall go to market strategy and are a valuable extension of the GitLab team.  Our channel partners help us scale sales, marketing and services engagement, and also help us reach new markets and decision makers.  Additionally, our partners help us:



1. Drive growth ARR through services capacity and capability to drive customer adoption and usage of the GitLab platform.
2. Drive and increase new customer ARR through their relationships, service engagements, and knowledge of accounts.


### How can GitLab sellers benefit from our channel partners?

GitLab channel partners have established sales forces that help us multiply our sales coverage. Through that coverage and deep customer relationships, partners can identify new customer opportunities and new sales opportunities with existing customers, resulting in ARR growth. Through their service offerings and vendor partnerships, they can deliver more complete solutions than GitLab can alone, and drive customer adoption of GitLab. As a result, the GitLab channel will:



1. Improve customer reach and experience
    1. Resellers/SI’s that know & can make intros to your customers
    2. Ease of order processing
2. Channel leverage
    3. Resellers/SI’s that bring us into new opportunities & grow existing
    4. Decreased Customer Acquisition Cost
    5. Improved Net & Gross Retention
3. Services Capacity to Adopt and Expand GitLab deployments
    6. SI’s that help our customers deliver more value
    7. Stage Monthly Active Users Acceleration
4. Market Position
    8. Acquire partners from the Atlassian/Cloud Bees channel
    9. Monetize the GitHub channel
    10. Align to the AWS channel


## Channels Partner Types


### Resellers

Primary monetization is through reselling GitLab licenses and services. Resellers can be a service partner too (often known as a Solution Provider).



1. VAR (Value Added Reseller): Channel services including resale, implementation, contracting, support, financing etc.
2. DMR (Direct Market Reseller): Primary business is resale of the software, often does not implement. Value are the contracts that these partners have in place with customers.
3. Distributor.  Help us scale our business by leading relationships with our Open partners worldwide.  Distributors hep us recruit, onboard, transact with and support services for partners.


### Services Partners

Primary monetization is through the sale of a partner’s own GitLab and devops services. This can be a one-time implementation, ongoing support or advisory, managed services, or outsourcing. Services partners will resell GitLab services, deliver services on behalf of GitLab or deliver GitLab certified services. Services partners can be a reseller partner too (often known as a Solution Provider).



1. Global Systems Integrators have a large global workforce and can deliver on almost any customer need. Examples: Accenture, Deloitte, Contino
2. Regional Systems Integrators are large workforce but with single continental focus and a more limited offering of services. Examples: CI&T, WWT
3. Boutique Systems Integrators are very focused DevOps partners that could be deep experts on GitLab and the nuances of getting it setup and running it. Examples - D-Ops and CPrime
4. Managed Service Providers provide ongoing support for solutions/applications. Examples: 2nd Watch, Rackspace

## Channels Partner Tracks

## Working with GitLab Channel Partners

### Partners can help you scale and working with them is comp neutral

[Channel Neutral Compensation](/handbook/sales/commissions/)

To incentivize working with our Channel partners, 'Channel Neutral' means that we will not reduce $ value to individual sellers even if the Channel business reduces total Net ARR to GitLab (via discounts or rebates). More information can be found on the [compensation page](/handbook/sales/commissions/).

FY21 commissions will be channel neutral for all deals through partners (including Distributors, if applicable), which means standard partner discounts are credited back to the salesperson and must follow [order processing procedures](/handbook/business-ops/order-processing/) to correctly flag partner attribution. Total Net ARR on the deal after all discounts will count towards quota credit, but the channel neutral amount does not qualify for quota credit and only pays out for compensation at BCR. See Channel Neutral section referenced in the [FY21 Commission Plan presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lPZAmdHPPJwhJ4felwsgDXopIt7Usn3UnK5siOpQMlY/edit#slide=id.g7da31a6494_6_0)

Partner Services also qualify for [FY21 Professional Services Spiff (v2)](/handbook/sales/commissions/). So as partners help customers adopt and expand their GitLab deployments, they can earn a Services Attach rebate and the GitLab sales team can earn the Professional Services Spiff.

### Partner Co-selling best practices, and how Partners can help with R7 and Command plans

In general Partners do not want to be told _generally_ “how to sell” but they **_do value _**tips and tricks about _selling GitLab_ (from your experience, what to watch out for, what are the effective sales motions, etc.). 

Partners often will have their own best practices selling methodologies in place, so it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> recommended AEs expect Partners to embrace the entire R7 approach, nor build out an entire Command Plan. However **_Partners can be valuable_** for collecting and sharing key elements of both.  



*   As a best practice, with support of the Channel Mgr if/as needed, AEs should be sure the Partner is pre-briefed prior any joint call with the customer. 
*   Be sure the Partner is clear on the talk track and the desired outcomes of the call. 
*   One efficient way to do this is schedule a call with the Partner 10 minutes just before the joint customer call.
*   Of course if schedules do not allow that, a brief email to the partner should also be effective.
