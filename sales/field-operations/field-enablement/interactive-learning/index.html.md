## Overview
All elearning courses tied to the [Field Certification Program](/handbook/sales/training/field-certification/) will utilize the Handbook as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT). For example, in order to learn more about a particular topic tied to the Field Certification, learners will be able to refer to the Handbook within the elearning course instead of having to open a new browser tab and manually navigating to the Handbook. 

The Field Enablement team will utilize the Articulate 360 Storyline Suite as the main course authoring tool. In Storyline, a [Handbook-first approach](/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/#gitlab-knowledge-assessment-handbook-first-documentation) is achieved by adding a web object on a slide so learners can access the Handbook on that particular topic.

## Interactivity in E-learning
Interactivity such as games, drag-and-drop, matching, and other interactive components in a published elearning course will not be accessible via the Handbook; however, all information conveyed to learners through the elearning course will have an associated Handbook page as needed. This will make sure that despite the interactivity of the elearning course, learners will have access to all topics covered in the Field Certification program via the Handbook.

## Course Development Workflow
Instructional designers will use the ADDIE instructional systems design (ISD) framework to design and develop Field Certification courses using Articulate 360. The workflow of course development will be as follows:
1. Create learning objectives
1. Design storyboard and get SME buy in
1. Outline course Handbook page 
1. Develop elearning
1. Conduct a course Alpha
1. Incorporate feedback
1. Conduct a course Beta (as needed)
1. Publish course in LXP
1. Announce course launch
1. Enroll learners (as needed)

## Handbook Course Documentation
A thorough needs assessment will be conducted to determine what net-new Handbook pages are needed as new courses are developed. The goal is for each course to have an associated Handbook page that will include learning objectives, static learning content, quizzes, and applicable links.
