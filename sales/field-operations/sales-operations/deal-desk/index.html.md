### **Sales Support**

#### Deal Desk SLA 

The Deal Desk team will do their best to respond to each request to '@sales-support' within 6 business hours. Revenue generating or current quarter requests will take priority, especially during Month & Quarter End. If a task is not resolved within 24 hours it will be escalated (if necessary). 

| Type of Request | First Response | Resolution |
|----- | ----- | ------| 
| Basic Quote Assistance | 6 Hours | 8 Hours | 
| Ramp Deal | 6 Hours | 24 hours |
| Flat Renewal | 6 Hours | 24 Hours |
| IACV/ARR Review | 6 Hours | 24 Hours |
| Contract Reset / Co-Term | 6 Hours | 24 Hours | 
| RFP/Vendor Forms | 6 Hours | Dependent on AM |

### SLA for EoA Ramp Deal Requests

The Deal Desk team will respond to E0A Ramp requests as quickly as possible. However, due to the complexity involved in building ramp deals, the SLA for an EoA Ramp Deal Order Form creation is as follows:

| Subscription Term Start Date | First Response | Resolution |
|----- | ----- | ------| 
| < 30 days in the future | 4 Hours | 1 Business Day | 
| > 30 days in the future| 4 Hours | 3 Business Days |

A Deal Desk team member will respond to your chatter request with an estimate on when the Order Form will be complete. Please let us know if your customer requires the quote in advance due to lengthy procurement cycles or budget planning reasons - exceptions will be considered in cases of urgency, or to meet a customer's needs.

#### Deal Desk - A Global Presence

The Deal Desk team is located around the world and will be available during standard business hours within most regions - typically 9:00am - 6:00pm for the local time of the team member.

#### Salesforce Chatter Communication

Deal Desk's primary communication channel is Salesforce Chatter. When you chatter `@Sales-Support`, it will automatically create a case in the Deal Desk queue. **Please do not tag Deal Desk team members directly in chatter or make a request through Slack direct message. Always uses `@Sales-Support` for SFDC requests or post `#sales-support` in Slack for general questions.** This ensures our team is working as efficiently as possible and that you are covered in case the DD team member who replied first is unavailable. If someone is working on a case, they will continue to support until the case is closed.  If an issue has been resolved, please chatter @Sales-Support to reopen a case.

Deal Desk team members monitor the queue throughout the day. For all cases directly related to opportunites, quoting/deal structure or booking a deal, Deal Desk will respond to a case within 6 hours, Monday-Friday, with the exception of National/Regional holidays. Resolution or escalation for these cases will occur within 24 hours. 

For cases related to Account Segmentation (ROE, Territory), account data, or account merges, Deal desk will reassign these cases to our Sales Operations team to review and resolve. 

To Chatter the DD team, tag `@Sales-Support`in Chatter on the related opportunity or account page and a short sentence on your request. If the Deal Desk team needs more information, we will follow up directly via Chatter. 


#### Slack Communication

##### Primary Slack Channel

Use our Slack channel in case of general, non-record related requests and/or urgent questions: 
**#sales-support** [If the request is related to a quote, opportunity, or account - please chatter on the page in Salesforce instead of the Slack channel.] 

##### Slack Best Practices

**Please avoid contacting the DD team members directly via Slack.** Utlizing the `#sales-support` channel is best to ensure timely coverage, helps others who may have similar questions, and aligns with our **Transparency** value. 

In case of a specific opportunity or quote related question please use SF Chatter (see section [Salesforce Chatter Communication](#salesforce-chatter-communication))

##### Slack Announcements

Desk Desk process updates and announcements will be communicated via `**#sales**` and `**#sales-support**` Slack channels. 

##### Deal Desk Office Hours

Weekly Deal Desk Office Hours are scheduled each Wednesday at 12 PM EST. During Month End, Office Hours will take place on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, scheduled in both AMER and EMEA time zones. Calendar invites will be sent to Sales-All Distribution group. Priority will be given to opportunities closing within the quarter. 

Supported topics include:
* Create or modifying a quote
* Quote approval acceleration
* IACV/ARR calculation
* Submitting an opportunity for close
* Validation/segmentation of closed opportunities
* And anything else to help drive opportunities closing within the quarter! 

#### Deal Desk AMA

Deal Desk AMA's are an opportunity to invite someone from Deal Desk to your local team call. We can help address any questions regarding quote processes, best practices, or unique deal structures. Think of this as an opportunity for your team to learn together on general topics for quoting or opportunity management. For specific questions related to in-flight opportunities, it is best to join [Deal Desk Office Hours](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#deal-desk-office-hours). 

Chatter or Slack #sales-support if you are interested in having Deal Desk join your team call! 

#### Proactive Opportunity Review

In an effort to proactively prevent common order issues (especially those that would require a customer to resign our order form) the Deal Desk team will conduct a manual review of all opps that meet the following criteria: 

- Close Date = Within Current Quarter
- Net ARR = $100k+ 
- Opportunity Stage - 4 OR 5 

Team members will review opps in their region each week. We are looking for anything that would prevent the opportunity from booking smoothly, including:

1. Check that quote is built correctly for the opportunity type and route to market (direct, channel, marketplace)
2. Review quote approval requirements are met
3. Review IACV / ARR (IACV review through FY21Q1)
4. Review PO Requirement. If the account requires a PO, chatter the rep with a reminder
5. Check with rep to determine whether any questions or additional needs, especially if you see something structured oddly on the opp/quote, or if it is a complex deal

**Review Cadence** 

The team will review opps on a monthly basis, as time allows throughout the work week. During the last month of any quarter, the review will be conducted weekly. 

### Calculating ARR

To calculate ARR, please review the [ARR in Practice](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/#annual-recurring-revenue-arr-and-salesforce) handbook page.

### **Zuora Quote Configuration Guide - Standard Quotes**

The following is intended as a step by step guide for opportunity owners or ISR's to learn how to create standard quotes for New Subscriptions, Amendments, and Renewal opportunities. 

#### New Subscription Quote

Follow this step by step guide for creating a **New Subscription** quote. Use a New Subscription quote when the customer is purchasing a brand new subscription, OR if the deal structure includes a Contract Reset. 

A.  Open the New Business opportunity and click the **“New Quote”** button.

B.  When prompted **select “New Subscription”** and click “Next.”

C.  Provide Quote, Account, and Subscription Term Details and click “Next.”

*   Select a Quote Template

| Template                            | Use For                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Order Form                 | Most quotes, including alliance marketplace transactions, EDU/OSS/YC, or Customers with an Existing Agreement (MSA) in place |
| Standard Order Form (Hide Discount) | Hide the Discount Column for Direct Deals. Otherwise Identical to the Standard Order Form Template       |
| Authorized Reseller Order Form      | Authorized Reseller Transactions                                                                         |
| MSP Order Form                      | Managed Service Provider Transactions                                                                    |
| Distributor Order Form              | Distributor Transactions                                                                                 |

*   If there is a **signed MSA** between the customer and GitLab, the **“Existing GitLab Agreement Effective Date” field** should be populated with the date of the MSA’s signature. If "Existing Agreement Effective Date" is populated on the quote object, the Order form will automatically generate with Acceptance Language that References the existing agreement. If it **is not populated** the language will default to Standard terms. 

*   Add any preapproved legal language selections to the order form. Checking the box next ot the langauge selection will automatically generate an order form with pre approved legal language - no need for Deal Desk intervention. Selections are as follows: 

| Toggle Field                   | Output                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Annual Payments                | Annual Payment Language will populate in Payment Details on the Order Form PDF           |
| Customer Reference Langauge    | Customer Reference Langauge will populate in Notes Section of the order form             |
| Add Quarterly True Up Langauge | Standard Quarterly True Up langauge will populate in the Notes section of the Order Form |
| Remove Signature Block         | Signature Block will be removed. Use for customers with Existing Agreements (MSA)        |

*   **Select “Sold To” and “Bill To” contacts.** Note that the “Sold To” contact will receive the EULA or License file via email. Note: Each contact record must have a complete address, if the address is not fully populated, you will need to update this before you can proceed with the quote. 
*   For **Channel deals,** populate the “Invoice Owner” and "Invoice Owner Contact" fields. For **Direct Deals** leave "Invoice Owner" and "Invoice Owner Contact" blank. 
    *   Ensure that the Invoice Owner Contact is connected to the correct reseller account - i.e. if the reseller is in Germany, the Invoice Owner Contact should also be based in Germany.
    *   If an "Invoice Owner" does not auto-populate in the drop down, this means that a Billing Account does not yet exist for the partner. Chatter `@Billing-ops` on the Partner account and ask for a Billing account to be created. 
*   Populate **“Initial Term”** in months. (i.e. for a two-year deal, enter “24”). For standard deals, "Initial Term" should always match the SKU that you are quoting (i.e. Premium - 2 Year = Initial Term 24 Months). 
*   If the customer or reseller is based in the EU, enter the “VAT ID” number. This is required to book the order. 

*   Note: Non-standard payment terms (Net 30 = standard) should be reflected on the quote object, and will require approval per the approval matrix.

D.  Select **“Add Base Products”** from the drop-down menu on the “Edit Products and Charges” page. Select the correct product and click Next.
E.  Enter the product quantity, and adjust the discount or effective price as needed. Click Submit.
F.   **Add Annual Payments** to a order form by:
* Checking "Annual Payments" checkbox on Quote Detail Page
* Updating "Initial Term" to 24, 36, 48, or 60. **If Intital Term is not updated correctly, the quote will not generate the correct Total**"
* **All Annual Payment quotes** must use the 1 - Year Product SKU. You will see an error message if you select Annual Payments and anything other than the 1 - Year SKU. 
G.  SuperSonics: Review the Zuora fields to determine whether any Cloud Licensing features apply to the subscription. For more information on Cloud Licensing, see: [SuperSonics and Sales Assisted Transactions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#supersonics-and-sales-assisted-transactions) 
H.  **Order Form Generation**
*   If no discounts or special terms are requested, click “Generate PDF.”
*   If the deal contains discounts that require approval, please submit the quote for approval using the button on the quote. The quote must be approved before the PDF can be generated.
    *   In the case of reseller deals, please obtain the approvals in Chatter based on the approval matrix.
*   **Order Form Manual Edits**
    *   Please note that Sales reps may only generate PDF versions of the Order Form. If you require special wording or other manual edits, please make the request by tagging `@Sales-Support` in chatter.

#### Amend Subscription Quote


This quote type should be only used when **new users are being added to an existing subscription during the current subscription term.** This includes both additional licenses to existing products, and true-ups. This also includes any scenario where the products are being changed during the term - i.e., an upgrade from Premium to Ultimate. Amendment quotes cannot extend a subscription term. 

Amendments to subscriptions must be processed entirely before any changes can be made via additional amendments or a renewal opportunity. This means that the Add On Opportunity should be Closed-Won before submitting a Renewal opportuntiy for approval. 

**A.  Add-On Quote Creation**

*   Create the Add-on opportunity on the latest closed won annual opp (Renewal or New Business) that is related to that subscription (use the "New Add On Opportunity" button)
*   Open the Add-On opportunity and click the **“New Quote”** button.
*   Select the **existing billing account**.
*   When prompted **select “Amend Existing Subscription for this Billing account**, and select the appropriate subscription. 
    *   Note: If there are multiple billing accounts or subscriptions available, and you are unable to determine which to choose, please ask @Sales-Support via Chatter.
*   Provide Quote Template, Account, and Subscription Term Details and click “Next.”

* Select a Quote Template - Note, Amendments must transact through the same route to market as the original order. 

|Template                             | Use For                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Order Form                 | Most quotes, including alliance marketplace transactions, or Customers with an Existing Agreement (MSA) in place |
| Standard Order Form (Hide Discount) | Hide the Discount Column for Direct Deals                                                                |
| Authorized Reseller Order Form      | Authorized Reseller Transactions                                                                         |
| MSP Order Form                      | Managed Service Provider Transactions                                                                    |
| Distributor Order Form              | Distributor Transactions                                                                                 |

*   If there is a **signed MSA** between the customer and GitLab, the **“Existing GitLab Agreement Effective Date” field** should be populated with the date of the MSA’s signature. If "Existing Agreement Effective Date" is populated on the quote object, the Order form will automatically generate with Acceptance Language that References the existing agreement. If it **is not populated** the language will default to Standard terms. 

*   Add preapproved legal language selections to the order form. Checking the box next ot the langauge selection will automatically generate an order form with pre approved legal language - no need for Deal Desk intervention. Selections are as follows: 

| Toggle Field                   | Output                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer Reference Langauge    | Customer Reference Langauge will populate in Notes Section of the order form             |
| Remove Signature Block         | Signature Block will be removed. Use for customers with Existing Agreements (MSA)        |
    
*   The **Start Date** cannot be set before the subscription start date.
    *   The **End Date** will automatically be set to co-terminate with the existing subscription.
    *   The **Initial Term** should match the initial term of the New Business or Renewal subscription that precedes this quote. (i.e. if you’re amending the quote halfway through a 12 month term, the Initial Term should be 12, not 6.
    *   The **GitLab Entity** must be the same as it was on the initial deal you’re amending.
    *   For **Reseller deals,** populate the “Invoice Owner” and “Invoice Owner Contact” fields.
        *   Ensure that the Invoice Owner Contact is connected to the correct reseller account - i.e. if the reseller is in Germany, the Invoice Owner Contact should also be based in Germany.
        *   ** We cannot change route to market through an Amendment quote**. If the original order was sold Direct, all subsequent amendments must also be Direct. If it was initially sold through a Partner, all amendments must go through the same partner for the duration of the subscription. 
    *   If the customer or reseller is based in the EU, enter the “VAT ID” number. This is required to book the order.
    *   If there is a **signed MSA** between the customer and GitLab, the **“Existing GitLab Agreement Effective Date”** field should be populated with the date of the MSA’s signature. In addition, select the **“EXISTING MSA”** quote template.
    *   Note: Non-standard payment terms (Net 30 = standard) should be reflected on the quote object, and will require approval per the approval matrix.
*   Under the **Edit Products and Charges** page, increase the existing license quantity to reach your total - i.e. enter the new total license count. This page will show all currently licensed products (marked “Original”), but the Order Form that generates will only show the added quantity and amount for the pro-rated period. 
*   **To add users to the existing subscription at a different price**, the new user licenses should be added as a separate product line. 
*   **True-Ups:** NOTE: The true-up SKU does not add users to the license - it's simply a retroactive one time charge. If you are conducting a quarterly or semi annual true-up for a customer with our former percentage-based fee schedule, do not use the true-up SKU unless the true-up is in conjunction with their renewal and the customer will be renewing for less users. Instead, you should add users using an appropriately priced subscription product SKU. If you are quoting true-up users, click “Add Products” and wait for the next page to load. Then, click “Select” and choose “Add Add-On Products.” Select True-Up and click Next. Edit the quantity and effective price. Click “Submit.”
*   **Order Form Generation**
    *   If no discounts or special terms are requested, click “Generate PDF.”
    *   If the deal contains discounts that require approval, please submit the quote for approval using the button on the quote. The quote must be approved before the PDF can be generated.
        *   In the case of reseller deals, please obtain the approvals in Chatter based on the approval matrix.
    *   **Order Form Manual Edits**
        *   Please note that Sales reps may only generate PDF versions of the Order Form. If you require special wording or other manual edits, please make the request by tagging @Sales-Support in chatter.

**B.  Upgrade or Switch Products During the Subscription Term**
*   Create an “Amend Subscription” quote by following the steps in Section 2 (A) above.
    *   The **Start Date** should be the date of the product exchange. 
    *   On the **Edit Products and Charges** page, select “Add Products” and wait for the next page to load.
    *   Click “Select” and click “Add Base Products.”
    *   Select the **new** product type, and the correct SKU. Click Next.
    *   Select the **Remove** drop down button (which is not fully visible) next to the current product, which you are removing in lieu of the new product.
    *   Adjust the new product line - quantity, discount. Click “Submit.”
    *   Note: On the Order Form, the product being removed will display with a negative amount reflecting the credit for that product for the remainder of the subscription term.

#### Renew Subscription Quote

This quote type should be used when the customer has reached the end of their subscription term and wishes to renew the subscription for another term, using the same term start date.  

Note: "Renew Subscription" quotes should be used even if the customer is renewing for a different term length than the previous period. i.e. If the customer is renewing a 12 month subscription for 24 months, choose "Renew Subscription" and enter "24" in the Renewal Term field.

    *   Populate **“Renewal Term”** in months. (i.e. for a two-year renewal, enter “24”)
    *   Select the proper **GitLab Entity.**
    *   For **Reseller** deals, populate the **“Invoice Owner”** and **“Invoice Owner Contact”** fields.
        *   Ensure that the Invoice Owner Contact is connected to the correct reseller account - i.e. if the reseller is in Germany, the Invoice Owner Contact should also be based in Germany.
    *   If the customer or reseller is based in the EU, enter the **“VAT ID”** number. This is required to book the order.
    *   If there is a **signed MSA** between the customer and GitLab, the **“Existing GitLab Agreement Effective Date”** field should be populated with the date of the MSA’s signature. In addition, select the **“EXISTING MSA” quote template.**
    *   Note: Non-standard payment terms (Net 30 = standard) should be reflected on the quote object, and will require approval per the approval matrix.
*   Click Next, to enter the Products and Charges page.
    *   Note: The product lines from the Initial Term are already listed and will be marked “Original.” You may add new products, update the quantity on the original license, or remove the existing license. To add users to an existing license at a different price, the new user licenses should be added on a new product line.

**B.   **Add Annual Payments** to a order form by:
* Checking "Annual Payments" checkbox on Quote Detail Page
* Updating "Initial Term" to 24, 36, 48, or 60. **If Intital Term is not updated correctly, the quote will not generate the correct Total**"
* **All Annual Payment quotes** must use the 1 - Year Product SKU. You will see an error message if you select Annual Payments and anything other than the 1 - Year SKU.

**D.  Renewal Using a New Subscription Quote**

If the customer needs to change the Quote Start Date (typically for Billing purposes) at time of Renewal, you will need to build a  New Subscription quote. We will also use a New Subscription quote if the deal includes a Contract Reset. 

*   Open the Renewal opportunity and click the **“New Quote”** button.
*   Select the **existing billing account.**
*   When prompted **select “New Subscription for this Billing account,”** and select the appropriate subscription. 
    *   Note: If there are multiple billing accounts or subscriptions available, and you are unable to determine which to choose, please ask @Sales-Support via Chatter.
*   Fill out the necessary information on the quote per the instruction under the **New Subscription Quote** section above. 
    *   **Note: The Start Date must be the renewal date.** 
*   Select a Quote Template

#### Quoting Annual True-Ups

In accordance with Section 6 of the [GitLab Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/#6-payment-of-fees), customers may be required to pay for Overage Users upon the expiration of a Subscription Term in order to renew the Software. 

Effective [ **INSERT DATE HERE** ], the "Trueup" SKU has been deprecated and replaced with 6 new annual True-Up SKUs, each of which tie to the related subscription SKU. When creating quotes that include a True-Up element, please select the appropriate True-Up SKU as listed below. For the avoidance of doubt, you must select the True-Up SKU related to the subscription SKU that was in use when the True-Up was incurred.
* Example: A customer purchased a 100 user SaaS - Premium subscription, and incurred 5 Overage Users. These Overage Users are charged as part of the customer's renewals. In this case, you should use the True-Up (Annually) - SaaS - Premium SKU.

**Self-Managed True-Up SKUs**

* True-Up (Annually) - Self-Managed - Ultimate: $1,188/seat/year
* True-Up (Annually) - Self-Managed - Premium: $228/seat/year
* True-Up (Annually) - Starter: $48/seat/year

**SaaS True-Up SKUs**

* True-Up (Annually) - SaaS - Ultimate: $1,188/seat/year
* True-Up (Annually) - SaaS - Premium: $228/seat/year
* True-Up (Annually) - Bronze: $48/seat/year

#### Co-Terming

Co-terming is when a customer wants to align two or more **separate subscriptions** with different end dates. Co-Terming is not the same as an Amendment quote (adding and prorating users for an **existing subscription**).


Ex). Customer has 2 separate subscriptions for Premium.

* Subscription 1 = 100 seats, expiring 2018-06-30
* Subscription 2 = 50 seats, expiring 2018-12-31

The most likely scenario is to co-term into the subscription ending last:

* On the renewal opportunity for subscription 1, create an amendment quote for subscription 2;
* The start date for the amendment will be 2018-07-01;
* Add 100 seats to the existing 50 and close as usual;

The other scenario is co-terming into the subscription ending first:

This requires two steps: first combining the subscriptions, then cancelling the leftover one.

* Create a new opportunity, with a quote amending subscription 1;
* The start date will remain unchanged, e.g. 2018-04-01;
* Add 50 seats to the existing 100 and close as usual;
* Once closed, create a new opportunity to cancel subscription 2 on the day before the start date of the previous quote e.g. 2018-03-31;

#### Quoting Guide: Starter/Bronze End of Availability + Tier Re-naming

**As of 2021-01-26, the following changes have been made to the quoting process in relation to the end of availability of Starter/Bronze:**

* Starter/Bronze SKUs will no longer be selectable for new subscription quotes. 
* Starter/Bronze new subscription deals quoted before 2021-01-26 will be honored and booked through and until the Quote Expiration Date provided that they have received CRO approval.
* Starter/Bronze SKUs will still be selectable for amendment and renewal quotes. Existing Starter/Bronze subscriptions can be amended to add users at the current list price, or renewed for one year at the current list price, until 2022-01-26. Any discounts applied to Starter/Bronze Add-Ons or Renewals will be subject to the [standard discount approval matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CH-uH_zr0qaVaV1QbmVZ1rF669DsaUeq9w-q1QiKPE/edit?ts=5d6ea430#).

**Silver/Premium + Gold/Ultimate Legacy SKU Quoting Guide**

As of 2021-01-26, the following changes have been made to the quoting process in relation to the renaming of Silver and Gold:

Salesforce Guided Selling filters have been updated. Legacy SKUs have been removed where appropriate, resulting in a shorter, cleaner list of products that can be sold. Legacy SKUs from previous product deprecations have also been removed.

* All legacy Premium, Silver, Gold, and Ultimate SKUs will begin the deprecation process. **New SKUs have been created in place of these legacy SKUs:**

| New Rate Plan Name      | Legacy Name |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| SaaS - Premium          | Silver      |
| Self-Managed - Premium  | Premium     |
| SaaS - Ultimate         | Gold        |
| Self Managed - Ultimate | Ultimate    |

* **New Business:** New Subscription quotes can only be created using the new SKUs listed above. 
* **Add-Ons:** For existing subscriptions that contain legacy SKUs, all Amend Subscription quotes will use the existing legacy SKU. i.e. If you upsell an existing Gold subscription, your amendment quote and Order Form will still use the legacy Gold SKU.
* **Renewals:** For existing subscriptions that contain legacy SKUs, **all Renew Subscription quotes will require that the legacy SKU be removed from the quote, and that the new SKU be added to the quote in its place for the renewal.** When quoting a renewal, *please follow the steps below to change the SKU:*
  * First, click **Select Products**
  * On the **Edit Products and Charges** page, select "Add Products"
  * Click "Select" and then click "Add Base Products"
  * Select the new SKU. Click Next.
  * Select the **Remove** drop down button next to the legacy SKU.
  * On the new SKU, adjust the quantity and pricing as needed. Click "Submit."
  * Note: On the Order Form, the legacy SKU will appear as "Removed."

* **Legacy SKU Grace Period**: Any quotes/Order Forms created before 2021-01-26, on which a legacy SKU was used, will be accepted for booking. All quotes/Order Forms created on or after 2021-01-26 must follow the applicable quoting requirements for each quote type listed above.

**Quote Discount Approval Module Updates**

* The quote approval module has been updated to recognize the new Premium and Ultimate SKUs referenced in the table above.
* The quote approval module has been updated to recognize the [Starter/Bronze EoA Option 2 upgrade offer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19T-ysFuEFWIlAv7Z9o1Q6-kVU9HKFb_nzGZ1uumpMLA/edit) (one year renewal/add-on upgrade).

#### Quoting Professional Services

**There are two separate ways to quote Professional Services, depending on whether the services are standard, or scoped/custom.**

##### Creating a Professional Services Quote for Standard Services

*   Standard services are those for which a SKU exists in Zuora CPQ.
*   Standard services can be added to any New Business, Add-On, or Renewal quote alongside subscription product SKUs. (i.e. If you are selling a 12 month SaaS Ultimate deal, you can add a separate SKU on the same quote to sell the Rapid Results offering.)
*   For Standard Services, a signed Order Form is sufficient to book the deal. (Note, some customers may also require issuance of a PO)
*   More information on [Professional Services SKUs](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/#professional-services-skus) 

##### Before submitting a Scoped/Custom Professional Services Opportunity for Closure:

*   For [standard professional services skus](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/#current-skus), only a signed order form is required.

##### Creating a Professional Services Quote for Scoped/Custom Services

*   Scoped/Custom Services are those that require consultation with the Professional Services team, and require a custom SOW to be drafted and signed by the customer. This includes any Professional Services that are not fully prepaid.
*   Scoped/Custom Services must always be quoted on a standalone opportunity, separately from any subscription products SKUs. (i.e. You may NOT sell a 12 month SaaS Ultimate SKU on the same quote/opp as Scoped/Custom Services).
*   Create a New Business Opportunity and select “Professional Services Only” under “Opportunity Record Type.”
*   Create a new subscription quote under the Professional Services opportunity by following the steps above under “new Subscription Quote.” Select the **GitLab Service Package** SKU. Update the price to reflect the total price on the SOW.
*   To gain support from the Professional Services team with a Custom SOW, initiate a scoping issue using the [Services Calculator](https://services-calculator.gitlab.io/) and work with a Professional Services [Engagement Manager](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/engagement-mgmt/).

##### Before submitting a Scoped/Custom Professional Services Opportunity for Closure:

*   Please note that the following items must be attached to the opportunity before it can be Closed Won:
    *   SOW signed by **both the customer and GitLab's PAO or CFO.****
    *   Cost Estimate spreadsheet (Link provided by the PS team)
    *   For opportunities with both - standard professional services skus AND a custom service package - then both a fully executed SOW and Cost Estimate is required 

#### How to Clone an Existing Quote

If you'd like to save time by cloning an existing quote, you can do so by doing the following:

1. On the Quote Detail page of the quote you want to clone, click Clone Quote.
1. On the Quote Clone Configuration page, select the following options:
    * Clone Products: Select to clone the products associated with the quote. This option only applies to the New Subscription quotes. Ensure that the products associated with the quote are maintained in the current version of the product catalog.
    * Maintain Quote: Select to be directed to the first step in the quote object workflow that allows you to edit the newly cloned quote. The flows are configured based on the quote type, i.e., New Subscription, Amendment, and Renewal, in the quote object workflow.
1. Click Next.
    * If you selected the Maintain Quote option, you are redirected to the first step in the Quote Wizard of the newly cloned quote.
    * If you did not select the Maintain Quote option, you are redirected to the Quote Detail page of the newly cloned quote.
1. Please note that you cannot clone the products on an amendment (add-on or renewal quote.)

#### How to Create a Draft Proposal

Follow the standard process for [quote creation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#zuora-quote-configuration-guide---standard-quotes). The Quote Object **does not** need to be approved before generating a Draft proposal. 

1. Click Edit Quote. 
2. Select the Draft Quote Template. Save. 
3. Click Generate PDF. A Draft Proposal PDF will be attached to the opportunity in the Notes & Attachments section. 

**Important Notes** 
- A Draft Proposal PDF is not an Order Form. All quotes must go through the applicable approval process before you can generate an Order Form. Draft Proposals are not guaranteed approval.
- A Draft Proposal PDF will not be accepted in place of an Order Form under any circumstance. 
. To generate a legitimate order form, you must update the Quote Template from the Draft selection to relevant order form template for the opp

### **Non-Standard Quotes**

Occasionally an opportunity will require a unique structure that is outside of the normal quote format. Examples of these scenarios are listed below. Deal Desk will partner with the Account Owner to structure the opportunity and provide guidance on creating the quote. Please chatter on the opportunity if you need assistance with one of these scenarios! 

#### Contract Reset

Contract Resets are used to perform an "Early Renewal" - i.e. start a new 12 month subscription before the renewal date. They can also be used if a customer needs to change a billing date or would like to change the term length, mid term. 

*   Open the Renewal opportunity and click the **“New Quote”** button.
*   Select **existing billing account.**
*   When prompted **select “New Subscription for this Billing account,”** and select the appropriate subscription. 
    *   Note: If there are multiple billing accounts or subscriptions available, and you are unable to determine which to choose, please ask @Sales-Support via Chatter.
*   Fill out the necessary information on the quote per the instruction under the New Subscription Quote section above. 
    *   **Note: The Start Date should be the new subscription term’s start date, or the “Early Renewal” date.**
*   Click Next and update the products and fees per the steps above.
*   **IMPORTANT:** Next, tag `@Sales-Support` in Chatter on the Renewal Opportunity to create a credit opportunity and quote to cancel the existing subscription, which in this scenario is being replaced with the new subscription. Deal Desk will then manually generate a Contract Reset Opp and Order Form to add the credit line into the order form once the quote has been fully approved.
*   Deal Desk will attach a PDF of the consolidated quote to the opportunity 
*   Sales team will send the order form to the customer for signature
*   Upload the signed order form to the renewal opp and to the credit opp as well and submit both opps for approval

On the main contract reset opportunity, populate the "Opportunity Category" field with "Contract Reset." On the associated credit opportunity, populate the "Opportunity Category" field with "Credit." 

All Contract Reset opportunities will be classified as a "Renewal" and will be subect to ARR Basis, which will impact overall Net ARR depending on the scenario. 

For more information on ARR calculation for Contract Resets, see [ARR in Practice](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/#calculating-net-arr-for-contract-resets).

#### Multi-Year Deals

In the case of multi-year deals, the Initial Term should be updated to reflect the number of months in the subscription term - 24, 36, 48, 60, etc. 

For prepaid multi-year deals, you must select the correct multi-year SKU (i.e. for a prepaid 2 year SaaS - Premium deal, select “SaaS - Premium - 2 Year”). Prepaid multi-year deals that do not utilize the correct multi-year SKU will be rejected. 

For multi-year deals, paid annually, you must select the 1 Year SKU, and click on the Annual Payments checkbox to add the necessary payment language to the Order Form. Multi-year deals paid annually that do not utilize the correct 1 Year SKU will be rejected.



For more information on ARR calculation for Multi-Year Deals, see [ARR in Practice](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/#how-net-arr-is-calculated-for-standard-deals).

### Ramp Deals 

A ramp deal is when a contracts a multi-year deal for users that will be fulfilled on a set annual schedule throughout the duration of the multi-year subscription term. In a Ramp, users are prorated from when they will be added. The customer pays upfront, or annually, for all users planned in the ramp schedule. For [Amendment quotes](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#amend-subscription-quote), the customer adds users throughout the subscription with no set schedule. 

Ramp deals are limited to multi-year deals, with 12 month ramp periods. See [ARR in Practice](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/#calculating-net-arr-for-ramp-deals) for more information.


#### How to Create a Ramp Deal

A.  To create a ramp deal, tag @Sales-Support in chatter on the opportunity. **Provide the following information for each ramp period:**
*   Start date/term length
*   Proposed ramp schedule
*   Bill To and Sold To Contact
*   Invoice Owner and Invoice Owner Contact (If Partner Deal)
*   Product, quantity, discount
*   Payment Terms (i.e. Net 30)
*   Any other requests (i.e. Price Lock, true up language, etc.)

B.  Request template:
*   Deal Desk has created a [G Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ho_ndKIZDvgdWOn873XONK2oc1tLloVJwlnpxgHYjiE/edit#gid=0) for Sales reps to enter ramp information.
    *   To use this template, copy the template to your own Drive, enter the information, and share your G Sheet with @Sales-Support in Chatter.

C.  Deal Desk will create the quotes and Order Form.

On the opportunity, populate the "Opportunity Category" field with "Ramp."

For more information on ARR calculation for Ramp Deals, see [ARR in Practice](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/#calculating-net-arr-for-ramp-deals).

#### How to Process a Professional Services SOW Amendment (Change Order)

Occasionally, changes will be made to a Custom SOW after an opportunity has been booked. These changes could include delivery (invoice) schedules or types of services delivered. The total value of the opportunity **should not change.** If the total value of an opportunity is negatively impacted, this will require an internal refund and rebooking of the order. Should there be additional revenue generated as a result of this Change Order, a new Professional Services Only opportunity is required to account for the _delta value_.

#### Creating Decomission Opportunties

Deal Desk will create Decommission (refund) opportunities for all Sales Assisted Orders. The Billing team will create Decommission (refund) opportunities for all Web Portal purchases. The creation process is the same for both Deal Desk and Billing. 

To create the decommission opportunity, navigate to the related Closed-Won Opportunity. Click 'Create Refund Opportunity'. Navigate to the opportunities tab under the Account page. Click on the newly created decommission opp, it will have 'REFUND' in the opportuntiy name. On the opportunity level, double check all fields populated as expected. For some multi-year deals, or partial refunds, 'Amount' may need to be updated manually. 

**Deal Desk** - After confirming all fields are correct on a Sales Assisted decommission, submit the opp for approval. 
**Billing** - After confirming all the fields are correct on a Web Portal Purchase, manually change the 'Stage' to 'Closed-Won'. 

#### Payment Schedule

*  Clone the original Closed-Won opportunity. Update the opportunity name to include “Amended SOW”.
*  Update the Original Closed-Won opportunity as duplicate, linking to the Amended SOW Opportunity.
*  Build a quote identical to the original closed-won opportunity. Update the quote to primary.
*  Attach the original SOW, the Amended SOW, and link to Cost Estimate to the Amendment Opportunity.
*  Submit the Opportunity for Deal Desk/Billing Approval.
*  The Opportunity Close Date for the Amended SOW should be manually updated to match the original Closed-Won opportunity.

#### Opportunities Requiring Multiple Invoices

If an opportunity requires multiple invoices due to a specific professional services delivery schedule, a separate opportunity is required for each invoice period. If there is no difference in number of seats or price across the years only one subscription and quote would be required (ie. Invoice Only opps do not require a quote object).

In FY22, multi year deals for recurring subscription products, paid annually, will be captured on one opportunity. 

**Opportunity Structure**

* Invoice Only Opp type should be New Business
* Each individual opportunity will require a quote object that is equal to the amount being invoiced
* All products, dates, and contacts should match the original opp / quote
* Build Invoice Only quote objects as a "New Subscription" quotes

**Invoice Amounts** 

If all payments associated with the opportunity are equal (ex. 3 payments of $10,000) the quote on the original opporunity must reflect the entire opportunity term. 

**Ex.** 

3 Year Subscription worth $30,000, broken out into 3 equal annual payments of $10,000. 
* Primary Opp Quote - 3 Year New Subscription Quote (using the 1 Year Product SKU). Term Length should be 36. 
* Invoice Only Opp - Year 2 - Update the Amount field to reflect the total to be invoiced. A quote object is not required.
* Invoice Only Opp - Year 3 - Update the Amount field to reflect the total to be invoiced. A quote object is not required.

If the payment amounts or user count per year are not identical, (ex. Year 1 - $15,000 Year 2 - $10,000, Year 3 $5,000)- then the original opporunity quote should only reflect the first year (invoice period) of the subscription. 

**Ex.** 

3 Year Subscription worth $30,000, broken out into 3 payments. Year 1 - $10,000, Year 2 - $7,000, Year 3 $13,000
* Primary Opp Quote - 3 Year New Subscription Quote (using the 1 Year Product SKU). Term Length should be 36. 
* Invoice Only Opp - Year 2 - Update the Amount field to reflect the total to be invoiced. A quote object is not required. (Use the same SKU as the original opp, update initial term to 12)
* Invoice Only Opp - Year 3 - Update the Amount field to reflect the total to be invoiced. A quote object should be created to reflect the total amount to be invoiced. (Use the same SKU as the original opp, update initial term to 12)

**Ex.** Professional Services Deal -Opportunity amount $300,000. 4 Deliverables are outlined in the Custom SOW to the customer, each deliverable includes a different date for delivery. This requires 4 opportunities because the customer will be invoiced after completion of each deliverable.


*  Opp 1 (Original Opportunity) - First Deliverable - $50k in services
*  Opp 2 (Cloned from Original) - Second Deliverable -$50k in services
*  Opp 3 (Cloned from Original) - Third Deliverable - $100k in services
*  Opp 4 (Clone from Original) - Fourth Deliverable - $100k in services

To create opportunities requiring multiple invoices: 

*  Clone the original forecasted opportunity
*  Update the opportunity name to include “Deliverable # and the Date of delivery. The close date should be the same for all opportunities (if SOW and Cost Estimate was received on 1/1/2020, all opportunities should show 1/1/2020 as the close date even if it will be invoiced in a future period).
*  Create a quote reflecting the value of the Deliverable. Build out each quote using the same SKU and discount (if applicable). The start date should match the delivery date outlined in the SOW.
*  The quote should follow the standard quote creation process (link to quote building process). Set the quote as primary. Repeat for all opportunities. The sum amount of all opportunities should equal the total amount for the SOW.
*  Attach the signed SOW and Cost Estimate link to **each opportunity.**
*  Submit the Opportunity for Deal Desk/Billing approval. The Billing team will flag each deliverable opportunity for future invoice periods.

Note: The "Payment Schedule" field on each opportunity should be populated with the value "Annual Payments" or "Custom Payment Schedule," whichever applies.

**Add-Ons to Opportunities with Multiple Billing Events**

- Scenario: The customer has a two-year subscription, paid annually. Each year's invoice amount is $100,000. 6 months into the subscription, the customer would like to add 100 users, totalling $75,000 over the remaining 18 months of the agreement.
  - In scenarios where we are amending a subscription where there are one or more outstanding out-year payments, one quote should be provided, where the base product is amended as appropriate.
  - How to read the Quote Subtotal: In these scenarios, the quote's subtotal will be higher than anticipated, as the subtotal will account for (1) the add-on you're currently quoting, as well as (2) the year 2 payment (which is scheduled and hasn't been invoiced yet).
  - How to prepare the Order Form: In these scenarios, Deal Desk will manually prepare the Order Form by (1) Generating the Order Form, (2) subtracting the oustanding year 2 payment from the Order Form Grand Total, and (3) adding annual payment language and totals to the Order Form. 
  - How to prepare the Opportunities: In these scenarios, the primary opportunity will represent the remainder of the year in question. For each year remaining in the agreement, Deal Desk should (1) create a debook opportunity to debook the current out-year Invoice opportunity, and (2) create a rebook opportunity to correctly rebook the out-year Invoice opportunity with the new, increased out-year Invoice total (representing the original Invoice amount PLUS the add-on Amount for that future period)
  - In these scenarios
    - Example: From the scenario above, the quote's subtotal would read $275,000 because it includes (1) the $75,000 Add-On, and (2) the outstanding $100,000 Year 2 Invoice/Payment. 
    - Order Form: Deal Desk would (1) Change the Grand Total to $75,000, (2) Add Annual Payment language, and (3) in the table, write that $25,000 is due upon receipt (represents the add-on amount for the remainder of the first year), and that $50,000 is due on the same date as the outstanding Year 2 invoice. 
    - Opportunities: There would be an existing Year 2 Invoice Opportunity with an Amount of $100,000. Deal Desk would debook that opportunity. Deal Desk would then rebook that opportunity with an Amount of $150,000.

### Miscellaneous (But Important) Information related to Quotes

A.  **To add users to an existing license at a different price**, please add the users on a new, separate product line.

B.  **To create a true-up/add-on quote for a multi-year deal**, please add **both** the true-up and increase the license count by the same number of users. Note that the user number cannot decrease during the term of a multi-year deal - i.e. in the case of a three-year deal, if the customer exceeds the 100 license count by 25 users, (1) True-Up SKU with 25 users, and (2) increase the license quantity from 100 to 125.

C.  **If the customer signs a renewal quote, but a true-up is required before the renewal date**, create an add-on opportunity from the closed renewal opportunity, use the same start date as the renewal, and add the necessary true-up.

D.  If you have **multiple quote objects** under one opportunity, the quote you are using **must be marked Primary.**

### Opportunity Categorization

The following fields are maintained by Deal Desk to distinguish standard vs. non-standard opportunities:

#### Opportunity Category

Opportunity Category Definitions are viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UaKPTQePAU1RxtGSVb-BujdKiPVoepevrRh8q5bvbBg/edit#heading=h.te2fab3byieu).

#### Opportunity to Decommission

*  This is a lookup field, where the name of the original opportunity (now being decommissioned) is entered. This field is required by validation rule if Opportunity Category = Decommission. Upon saving, the linked opportunity will automatically be categorized as "Decommissioned" via process builder.

#### Payment Schedule

*  Prepaid (Default Value)
*  Annual Payments
*  Custom Payment Schedule

#### Quote Entity Information
