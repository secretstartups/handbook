  Steps to create an issue for an account list import
</summary>

Here are the guidelines for requesting account list loads from Sales Operations.
Please follow the instructions below.
The SLA for account list loads into Salesforce is 5-7 business days.

**For uploading a list of net new accounts**

- We have a template you can use to dedupe a list of accounts you have sourced [here in the google drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zm4uA2_d7aj31BY2wTxNw6HoElyWJQkjMYY4e1D3tRM/edit#gid=1823098798).
  This template will help you dedupe the account list and also format your list for upload into Salesforce.
  Please follow the directions in the README in the template doc and reach out to #sales-support in Slack if you have any questions.

**Preparing the list:**

1. Clean up list to remove any duplicates and columns not needed.
1. Update field names to Salesforce compatible values. Only include the required fields listed below.
1. Unless you discuss with us prior, nothing else will be loaded and the extra columns will be ignored in the import.
1. Account Source format: List - Name of Source - Date with no spaces or characters.
1. Create an issue in our [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations) using the Account List Import [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues).
   Include a link to the list and description of the list load.
1. One tab per sheet, one list load per sheet / one sheet per issue.

  Steps to update existing reports with ARR fields
</summary>


Below are the steps to update and/or replace ACV with ARR in existing SFDC reports and dashboards.
 
1. **Step 1:** Navigate to the report that needs to be updated 
1. **Step 2:** Click on the **Customize** button to make edits
1. **Step 3:** In the **Preview** section of your report, click on the carrot next to **Show** and make sure  Details has been selected.  This will populate all the fields currently added to your report.
1. **Step 4:** In the **Fields** panel on the left side of your screen, enter “ARR” into the Quick Find search to populate available ARR fields
1. **Step 5:** Drag the ARR field(s) you want to add to your report from the **Fields** panel and drop into the reporting grid.("Net ARR" is the standard field)
1. **Step 6:**  Once your ARR field has been added to the report grid, hover over the name and select the carrot.  From there choose the **Summarize this field** option and check the applicable summary option(s). Select **Apply**
1. **Step 7:** Remove any old IACV fields by dragging them from the report grid to the **Fields** panel OR hover over the name and choose **Remove Column** from the drop down list
1. **Step 8:** If there is a chart or a graph associated with your report that has been edited, you should also edit the chart to reflect your field changes. After you have added and summarized the Net ARR field, Select **Edit** on the very left corner of the chart. On the pop-up screen, change the data that is populated as Sum of Net IACV/Incremental ACV to Sum of Net ARR from the drop down list and Select **Ok**.
1. **Step 9:** When you’ve added and removed all appropriate fields, click the **Run Report** button at the top of your screen.
1. **Step 10:** On the following screen, review your changes to ensure the report is functioning as you expect (select the **Hide Details** button if you don’t want to see all fields) and click the **Save** button. 
1. **Step 11:** In many cases, no changes need to be made to the name or location of the report so choose **Save** or **Save & Return to Report** to complete the final step.  However, if the report name references IACV in any capacity, please update the report name to the corresponding ARR from the **Report Properties** tab at the top before your final Save option.

**Common fields that need to be updated**


| **Existing Field Name** | **Field to Replace With** | 
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | 
| Net IACV                | Net ARR                 |

## **Important Resources & Processes**

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
  Primary Quote System
</summary>

The Primary Quote system is a 1:1 relationship in SFDC that connects the total transaction amount on a quote with the amount on its related opportunity.
This is to ensure we are forecasting the same amount that we will book and enables further automation as the quote is sent to Zuora billing.
To support sales situations that require multiple quotes (for instance: a small deal option and a big deal option), sales reps can identify which one of their quote is "Primary".

  Salesforce Access Removal Process
</summary>

1. To ensure the appropriate users have access and that we're being fiscally responsible in terms of overall usage, users with no usage in 90 days will be deactivated.
1. Usage will be reviewed once at the beginning of the second month of the quarter so as not to disrupt any quarter end/quarter start cadences. The dates are scheduled on the Field Ops calander.
1. An [Access Change Request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#access-change-request) will be created and an email will be sent to users as extra notification.
1. If access is needed in the future, please submit a new [Access Request](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request) and we can confirm if SFDC is the correct place to gather this information or if other tools can provide it.

</summary>

**Identifying the Users**

1. Check the Data in the [Provided Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aGGo):
   - Make sure the last login date is set to LESS than or equal to 90 Days ago.
   - Verify that no integration users or users that might be tied to an external system are not included in the access removal. If there are questions, error on the cautious side and work with Sales Systems.
1. Create an [Access Change Request](/handbook/business-ops/employee-enablement/it-ops-team/access-requests/#access-change-request)
   - List the users that will be removed so that we have record of reason and users if needed in the future.
1. Email Notification:

   - Work with Sales Operations Manager to send the email notification. This is an extra step for extra visibility to users and might not always be needed depending on volume and other communication that has occured.
   - Example Email:

     Hope that you are having a good week. We in SalesOps are doing a cleanup of our tech stack tools to ensure the appropriate users have access and that we're being fiscally responsible in terms of overall usage. During this process, we've discovered that nearly **XXX** Salesforce.com users haven't logged in for 3 months or more. If you're receiving this message, your user account falls into this bucket.
     As such, I'm writing to let you know that we'll be deactivating your SFDC license on XXX in an effort to ensure that we have enough licenses to provision to our new and existing Sales people; who leverage the tool daily.
     So what does this mean for you?  
      Effective XXX you will no longer have access to SFDC
     If there's critical SFDC data that you need for your role, please submit a new Access Request and we can confirm if SFDC is the correct place to gather this information or if other tools can provide it
     Please let me know if you have any questions.

1. Deactivating Users in Salesforce
   - From Salesforce, access the setup menu and then manager users.
   - Locate the user and uncheck the Active box, or click the Freeze button. Freeze should only be used if the user can not be fully deactivated due to impact to other system or process.
   - If a user is frozen set a reminder in an issue to go back and deactivate user once related systems / process have been udpated.

  Sales Operations Case Management
</summary>

**What:**
Salesforce case management system to enable the transfer of certain cases (created from Chatter requests) from the Deal Desk group to the Sales Ops group to take action and respond to the original chatter request.
   - As of 2020-09-21, this will include all cases pertaining to account ownership/ROE and account segmentation, except for any cases that touch closed opportunities. 

**Where:**
- [Deal Desk Queue](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/500?fcf=00B4M000004O4ni)
- [Sales Ops Queue](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/500?fcf=00B4M000004tewG)

**How:**
1. All Sales Support Chatter requests will continue to flow into the Sales Support queue managed by Deal Desk.
1. Upon reviewing a case and identifying it as an account ownership/ROE or account segmentation request, Deal Desk will change the “Case Reason” field to “Account Reassignment/ROE” or “Account Segmentation Review.”
1. Deal Desk will then change the Case Owner to “Sales Ops Queue,” which will move the case out of the Sales Support queue into the Sales Ops queue. 

**Who:**
1. Enterprise EMEA: Meri Gil Galindo 
1. Enterprise East: Amber Stahn
1. Enterprise West: Kira Savage
1. Enterprise APAC: Meri Gil Galindo
1. Public Sector: Jeny Bae
1. Commercial (Mid-Market & SMB) Leadership: Tav Scott
1. Commercial (Mid-Market & SMB) EMEA / APAC: Monika Deshmukh
1. Commercial Amer (Mid-Market & SMB): Jeny Bae
1. Escalations / Approvals: Lindsay Schoenfeld (DRI), James Harrison 

**Notes on Case Behavior:**
1. Changing the “Case Owner” to the name of an individual team member marks that team member’s ownership of the case. This action can be taken at the individual case level or in bulk on the queue level.
1. When case ownership is updated to a Sales Ops team member, the case will remain visible in the Sales Ops queue until closed.
1. Changing the “Status” field to “In Progress” shows that someone is currently working on the case. 
1. By changing Status to “In Progress,” ownership will automatically change to the individual who changes status. 
1. By changing Status to “Closed,” the case will no longer appear in the queue.
   - Note: Check the “Suppress auto case reply” button in the same motion, before saving, to prevent automated Chatter posts. If you do not check this box, and you change the status to “In Progress,” upon saving the case, Salesforce will create a Chatter reply from your account, tagging the original requester, noting that you are working on the case. Similarly, when you close the case, Salesforce will Chatter the requester to note that the work is complete.
Click the “Related Chatter Object” link to view the original request. 

**General Notes:**
1. If working a case, and the requester makes a second request out of scope, please tag Sales Support so that a new case is opened for Deal Desk to review the request.
1. If working a case, and any aspect of the request relates to ownership of a closed opportunity, please change the case owner back to Sales Support for Deal Desk to review the request.
1. **Cases Black Out Week:** The last week of each quarter, Sales Operations will not be responding to new cases that have been submitted.  This is to allow them time to review approved Account movements from the current quarter, validate the moves and prepare them for new Account Ownership the first week of the following quarter.  For urgent case request during this time, chatter sales-support as well as the Sr. Manager of Sales Operations for review.

<summary markdown='span'> Common Scenarios for Sales Operations team on completing Sales Operations Cases
</summary>

## Scenarios (these will expand):

1.  Request to own an Account currently owned by the Sales Admin user:
   - Check for duplicates, accurate segment and territory data, accurate reflection of hierarchy.
   - Follow the [ROE](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/#objectives) to assign the account to the correct owner.
   - If territory or segment needs to be updated, follow the [Account Review Time Frame and Fields ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVz-SzYvBZ6odBW7UoHd4E4b_EUIJgZu7nNY_1StYJs/edit?ts=5f775d4e#gid=0)doc.
1.  Request to own an Account currently owned by a Sales or Marketing Operations team member:
   - NOTE: Most of the time these accounts came from a list load and need extra care in data validation.
   - Check for duplicates, accurate segment and territory data, accurate reflection of hierarchy.
   - Follow the [ROE](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/#objectives) to assign the account to the correct owner.
   - If territory or segment needs to be updated, follow the [Account Review Time Frame and Fields ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVz-SzYvBZ6odBW7UoHd4E4b_EUIJgZu7nNY_1StYJs/edit?ts=5f775d4e#gid=0)doc.
1.  Request to reassign an account owned by the Impartner Integration user:
   -  Chatter the Channel Manager to assist and validate the move.
1.  Request to reassign an account owned by the Vartopia Integration user:
   -  These customer accounts are OK to move and should follow the [ROE](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/#objectives) .
1.  Request to move a Channel / Partner account from or to a Sales Rep or Channel Manager:
   -  Chatter the Channel Manager to assist and validate the move.
1.  Request to move an account to a Public Sector SAL. 
   - Since PubSec is excluded from TSP at this time, the process will be different.
   - Always cc Brent Caldwell on the chatter for awareness.  If unsure, ask Brent to advise on correct owner/territory. 
   - Reference the [Master Territory List Public Sector Account Coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19LmWOxDegBfuPCdFK5e0voIUh7EpmF_OT4H4gY9YHUU/edit#gid=1263929675) sheet to determine the owner and the territory. The master tab will give the overview of the territory / SAL relationship.  The following tabs will list the accounts that belong in each territory.
   - NOTE: Public Sector accounts use the **Owner field** and the **Account Territory field**. These will be the only 2 fields to update for Public Sector requests.

<summary markdown='span'> Sales Operations Monthly Close 
</summary>
At the end of the month Sales Operations will create an issue in the Sales Operations project using the monthly close template.  The monthly close template consists of the items below.

### Field Marketing Manager Updates - Operator's Guide
The `Field Marketing Manager` field on the account is maintained by Sales Operations. Reporting for acccounts that need updated are on the[SalesOps CleanUp Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000skZj).  Requests to update the field will come in through Chatter requests or Sales Operations issues for requests to change more than 10 accounts.

1. Enterprise, Mid-Market and First Order accounts are updated through LeanData routing and the mapping is maintained in the [Territories Mapping File - SSoT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=1404562293). 
1. Named and PubSec are dataloaded manually on a monthly cadence. PubSec mapping is maintained in the Master Territory List Public Sector Account Coverage file.  Named mapping is maintained in [Territories Mapping File - SSoT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=1404562293)in the Named Reps tab. 

### Sales Admin Opportunity Updates - Operators Guide
Many opportunities and accounts are owned by Sales Admin.
These opportunities and accounts are updated twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays. We also do an additional upload during the end of the month for closing. 
We leverage the [Sales Admin Owned Opps Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYRM) and this [Territories Mapping file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=1159245802) to update the Sales Admin Owned Opps and accounts. 

**Types of fixes:** 
1. **Easy** - opportunities owned by Sales Admin that have Account owners populated to match
2. **Hard** - opportunities and accounts owned by Sales Admin that needs to be manually mapped and assigned to the correct owner

**Steps to update Easy Fix Opportunities** 
1. Locate the Easy Fix Sales Admin Owned Opportunities [Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aiGB) from the [dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYRM).
2. Export the report into an Excel or Google Sheets.
3. Update the the Opportunity Owner field, making sure to match the Opportunity owner with the account owner. 
4. Clear out the TSP Date, and next TSP owner fields to avoid reassignment.
5. Use dataloader to update the opportunities. 

**Steps to update Hard Fix Opportunities and Accounts** 
1. Locate the Hard Fix Sales Admin Owned Opportunities [Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aiGL) from the [dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYRM).
2. Export the report into an Excel or Google Sheets and instert 2 rows on the sheet to add Owner ID for both accounts and opportunities. 
3. First, determine the account's market segment to ease the mapping process. Filtering by Market Segment allows for easier vlookup process. Sales Ops uses this [mapping file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=1159245802) to assign opportunities and accounts.
4. Sort the “DataFox Country” field A → Z, to populate multiple opportunities with of the same territories and populate.
5. Since many opportunities and accounts are missing the Datafox country fields, "ZoomInfo Country" and "Billing Country" fields are used also to populate as well.
6. There may be multiple opportunities and accounts without any billing information. However, some may have Zip codes populated, which we can do a quick google search to find the territory and map to the corresponding AE. 
7. If there is no Datafox, ZI, or billing information on the account or opportunity of the company, look up the company by name or by contact and or the account's billing information and perform a google search to populate as much information as possible. If no information is found, tag billing ops to obtain the zuora billing address information to populate the billing fields on the account. 
8. Repeat this process for each Market Segment (SMB/MM/Large) making sure each Territory is correct.
9. Clear out the TSP Date, and next TSP owner fields to avoid reassignment.
10. Double check to make sure all opportunities are populated. 
11. Prepare the upload sheet and update using dataloader. There will need to be 2 uploads for Hard fixes: One for Opportunities, and One for accounts. 

**Things to Remember** 
1. Remember to check the order type of the opportunity. Many accounts have First Order Account Executives so make sure to assign the opportunities to the correct owner.
2. Double check opportunities closed over $2,500 that are populated for SMB. Make sure to check the account information is correct and not wrongly assigned. 
3. Make sure to clear the TSP Date and TSP owner fields to avoid reassignment to other Account Executives after the weekly update.
4. Upload the accounts and opportunities in small batch sizes on dataloader to avoid errors.
5. Currently, all accounts in China, Macao or Hong Kong are assigned to JiHu User . For these accounts, make sure to check off the `JiHu Account` field.

  Merging Accounts
</summary>
Sales Operations is responsible for identifying and merging duplicate Accounts in SFDC.  

**There are two primary use cases to consider when merging duplicate Accounts:**
1. Prospect and Prospect Account merges
1. Prospect and Customer Account merges

**There are also two primary ways in which Accounts can be merged:**
1. Automated via RingLead
1. Manual Merges in SFDC

**Steps to Manually Merge Accounts**
1. Open tabs of the Accounts you want to merge. You can merge up to 3 Accounts at a time.
   - If one of the accounts in question is a **Channel Account**, be sure to check with the Channel Ops team in chatter first to confirm it can be merged
   - **Helpful Tip**: Change the Name of both accounts to something that you can find easily.
      - Example - You need to merge CustomerCentral with Customer Central Add 'Merge' to the end of the Account to be merged Account 1: CustomerCentral MERGE Account 2: Customer Central
   - **Customer Accounts/Billing Account ID:** If the Account that is being deleted (merged into another account) has a Billing Account associated with it, please copy the Billing Account Number, and paste it into chatter on the Account that will remain. Tag Billing-Ops and ask them to link the Billing Account to this SFDC account.
1. Click on the Accounts tab in Salesforce.
1. Scroll down, in the bottom right hand corner of the page, click “Merge Accounts”
1. Search the name of the Accounts you want to merge - following the example above - in the search bar type xCustomer
1. Select the checkbox on the left of each account to merge, click Next.
1. Review this section carefully. It’s best practice to keep the most accurate information when you merge accounts. You will be able to select one record to move the information into.
1. On the top of the Merge Page you can Select which account URL you want to keep.
1. Once you have reviewed the information, click “Merge”.

## **Sales Operations Sponsored Dashboards and Maintenance**

The Sales Operations team has sponsored a comprehensive but consumable "Reporting Package" (via SFDC Dashboards) with validated (SalesOps approved) metrics to the Account Executives.
This list will continue to evolve and will be maintained during the onboarding and offboarding process.
In addition to sponsored reporting, Sales Ops will maintain existing reports by archiving or deleting any report or dashboard not used in 180 days.

### **Territory Success Planning (TSP)**

TSP is an automated process workflow intended to properly segment & route Salesforce accounts to the correct Sales territory & respective owner.
This clarifies who should own which accounts & reduces current Ops overhead to manage manually.
TSP fields are designed to be real time reflections of the best data we have, not necessarily the current Go To Market approach.
Requests to override the TSP information can also be submitted in the Account Review section of the account.

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Operators Guide: Territory Success Planning (TSP) </summary>

**Primary TSP Workflow Components**

1. **Account Routing** (_Next Owner recommendation process_):
   - Sales Segment (i.e. max employee count of the account hierarchy)
   - Primary Account HQ Address (of top Parent Account in the hierarchy)
     - Inputs for both are formulated via our standardized account enrichment tools (in order):
     - Manual Override > DataFox > Zoominfo > Ship-To > Bill-To
   - LeadData then compares these TSP Input Values against our [SSoT Territory Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=720021722) & automatically outputs an Approved Next Owner and Territory.
2. **Account Assignment** (_Account Transfer Process_):
   - (Re)Assignment of an account to the correct owner
   - Updating of Account Territory, Sales Segment, Employees fields

**Firmographic TSP Fields**

- `[TSP] Sales Segment`: Segment of the account based on the MAX employee count in that account's hierarchy (regardless if MAX is parent or child).
- `[TSP] Account Employees`: Number of employees **for this specific account**
- `[TSP] MAX Family Employees`: MAX employee count (number) in hierarchy
- `[TSP] Address (Street, City, State, Post Code, Country)`: Location of Ultimate Parent Account based on the TSP data hierarchy
- `[TSP] Geo Story`: Source of address data from TSP Data Hierarchy

**Ownership TSP Fields**

- `[TSP] Next Approved Owner`: Owner of territory as determined by [SSoT Territory Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=720021722)
- `[TSP] Transfer Date`: Date when account ownership will change to `TSP Next Approved Owner`

**Territory TSP Fields**

- `[TSP] Territory`: Territory account falls under, as per the [SSoT Territory Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTDCaHN-i_xrfiv_Tkg27lYbZ3LHsERySkvv4cPsSNo/edit#gid=720021722)
- `[TSP] Region`: Sales territory region the account falls under
- `[TSP] Subregion`: Sales territory sub-region the account falls under
- `[TSP] Area`: Sales territory area the account falls under

</details>

### **What if TSP is wrong? How can I request a change?**

In the event our data enrichment tools are outdated or incorrect (primary address or employee count), you can chatter @sales-support and request for an update. Please provide as much detail as possible, justification for the requested change and website links with the information to be reviewed. Be sure to copy your manager if additional approvals will be needed. Please allow at least 48 hours for account changes to take place once the review process begins.

 <details>
<summary markdown='span'>Operators Guide: Process for Requesting TSP Changes:</summary>

**Operations Review Process:**

- Ops will be assigned cases to review and make updates to the `[Admin]` fields in the `Account Review Admin` section on the account.

  - `Number of Employees: Manual - Admin`

  - `Account Address - Manual Source - Admin`

  - `[Admin] Address Street`

  - `[Admin] Address Post Code`

  - `Number of Employees: Manual Source -Admin`

  - `[Admin] Address City`

  - `[Admin] Address State`

  - `[Admin] Address Country`

- Turnaround time for Approved TSP changes to re-populate typically takes 24-48 hours.
  - Accounts with a `[TSP] Transfer Date` populated a day in the future will be re-routed that night to the `[TSP] Next Approved Owner`.
  - `Account Territory`, `Sales Segment` & `Employees` fields will also be updated upon TSP transfer, to continually align accounts.

</details>

### **Opportunity Splits**

The Sales Operations team supports the opportunity credit split approval process with support from Deal Desk. Sales Operations also maintains the process and data maintenance for opportunity splits outside of credit splits. A non-credit split is strictly functionality to support correct 100% split allocation to the opportunity owner when a credit split does not apply. The non-credit splits are automated and the tasks will be to monitor the data for accuracy in Salesforce, ensuring correct data in CaptivateIQ and Clari.

[Opportunity Splits Approval Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/forecasting/#opportunity-splits)

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Operators Guide: Opportunity Splits </summary>

**Opportunity Split Rules**

1. Deal Desk, Sales Comp and Sales Ops are the only users with permissions to add, edit, update and delete splits.
2. 100% Split always goes to the opportunity owner
   - This does not apply for a credit split. Ex: 50/50 or any other percentage split.
   - If the opportunity is incorrectly assigned, the split should still match the owner until correct opportunity assignment is made.
   - This is automated and should be monitored on this [Exception Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oXQt) weekly.
3. There will never be a split that totals above 100%.
4. SFDC reports and Dashboards will only reflect opportunity splits if the report type includes opportunity splits.

**Opportunity Splits in Clari**

- Clari will pull the split data out of SFDC.

**Updating | Adding | Deleting a Split In Salesforce**

1.  Navigate to the opportunity in SFDC.
2.  Locate the opportunity splits relationship by using the hover links at the to or scrolling down the page.
3.  Choose the button to add or edit a split.
4.  Once on the split page, assign either the approved credit split, or edit the existing split percentage.

### **Sales Operations Owned System Provisioning**

Below are instructions on how Sales Operations provisions users within the various Sales-owned systems and the process followed.

For status on an issue please view the [Sales Operations Access Request Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/boards/1959331).

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Operators Guide: Sales Operations Owned Provisioning </summary>

### Sales Operations Access Request Labeling System

1. SalesOpsAR::Action Needed - Sales Ops action item is immediate or within current FQ.
1. SalesOpsAR::In Progress - Sales Ops action item is presently being worked on.
1. SalesOpsAR::On Hold - SalesOps AR that is blocked or not presently w/in scope of work.
   1. SalesOPS: Waiting on SFDC License - a reason an AR might be on hold.
1. SalesOpsAR::Completed - Sales Ops has completed their task on this issue although the issue may not be closed.

### Sales Operations Provisioning Workflow

### Baseline Templates | New Hires

1. The onboarding issue will auto create the AR on day 2
2. The templates will automatically:
   - Add the SalesOpsAR::Action Needed label
   - Auto assign to the provisioning DRI listed in the [tech stack YAML file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml). 
3. The DRI will receive an email when a new AR is created
4. All will be able to monitor the [Sales Ops Access Request Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/boards/1959331)proactively.
5. When the AR is picked up by the Sales Operations team member, the team member will:
   -assign the issue to themself (if not already auto assigned)
   -add the label SaelsOpsAR::In Progress
6. The Assignee should be responsible for working the AR to completion by completing all Sales Operations task items and working the label system accordingly. NOTE: If a new task appears in the Sales Operations section, reach out in slack or on the AR to clarify the ask and to make sure it is in the correct provisioner section.  Do not skip it. 
7. If Assignee is out of office, the rest of the team is responsible for moving the AR forward in a timely fashion and can see ARs in flight by looking at the [Sales Ops Access Request Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/boards/1959331)proactively.

### Single Person or Bulk Access Request

1. The user will manually create a [single person or bulk AR](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request)

   - Add the SalesOpsAR::Action Needed label
   - Leave the assignee blank
   - Assign to the provisioning DRI listed in the [tech stack YAML file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml). 
3. The DRI will receive an email when assigned, or can see the AR based on the label.
4. All will be able to monitor the [Sales Ops Access Request Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/boards/1959331)proactively.
5. When the AR is picked up by the Sales Operations team member, the team member will:
   -assign the issue to themself (if not already assigned)
   -add the label SaelsOpsAR::In Progress
6. The Assignee should be responsible for working the AR to completion by completing all Sales Operations task items and working the label system accordingly.

Below are instructions on how Sales Operations offboards users within the various Sales-owned systems.

1. Sales Operations DRIs will add the salesOps label to any Offboarding issue with SalesOps tasks and work off of this list view to identify users to offboard: [Ready to Offboard List](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/employment/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=offboarding&not[label_name][]=SalesOps%20Tech%20Stack-Completed).
1. This can also be pulled by going to the employment project and filtering using the Offboarding and SalesOps labels.
1. When the user has been deactivated in the systems listed for the Sales Operations DRIs, or the items are completed, the Sales Ops team member will add the SalesOps Tech Stack-Completed and/or SalesOps Records-Completed label(s) identifying that issue as 'Done.'

### End of Quarter Blackout Period
To ensure that Field Sales can solely focus on closing business during the final weeks of a quarter, Sales Operations will not release any new systematic or internal processes that directly impact the Sales team.  This period will begin roughly the third Monday of the final month of the quarter (or about 2 weeks prior to end of quarter) and last for the balance of that quarter.
