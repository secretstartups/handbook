1. Review current quarter forecast and plans to meet and exceed sales goals in the coming quarter (and beyond)
1. Identify and prioritize specific requests that will help Sales be successful

### QBR Schedules
QBRs are held in the following months and typically are a mix of in-person and virtual formats. This is subject to change based on any outside conditions that make it unsafe for the team to travel (i.e. COVID-19).

1. May: Virtual
1. Aug: In-person (virtual in FY21 due to COVID)

QBRs are typically organized by region, and the agenda is determined by the Regional Directors (RDs) and/or Area Sales Managers (ASMs) for those regions. In addition, Quarterly Sales Leadership QBRs will be held following the regional QBRs.

## QBR Best Practices

### Best Practices for RDs/ASMs/SALs/AEs
1. One ASM per day for remote QBRs.
1. ASMs serve as the DRIs for attendance in their sessions.
1. QBRs should be an inclusive environment – sales team members should encourage participation from other members of their account teams as well as delegates from other areas of the business.
   1. Invite your SDR Manager, Field Marketing delegate, and TAM Manager to provide a brief (5 minute) update during each QBR.
   1. Channel & Alliances delegates should be given 15-20 minutes in the agenda for each QBR to present on progress in the region.
1. Any changes to the QBR schedules should be made no later than two weeks before the scheduled start of QBRs to avoid calendar disruptions for participants.
1. All SALs/AEs should complete their QBR decks no later than 2 business days prior to their QBR session. (Note: For QBRs that occur on the first business day of the new quarter, the standard is one business day.)
1. All RDs/ASMs/SALs/AEs should pre-read other QBR decks for their session. Questions should be left ahead of time in the coordinating notes document.
   1. ASMs should review their team's QBR asks and pre-prepare a list of prioritized asks to review in their QBR session. (See the [Field Operations QBR Request Intake Process](/handbook/sales/qbrs/#intake) below for more information.)

### Best Practices for Attendees
1. Please join on time and ensure your microphone is muted to avoid disruptions.
1. Please be an active participant in the QBR session – join on video (if possible), answer questions related to your area of expertise/team, and participate in discussions.
1. Please contribute by taking notes during the QBRs. Everyone can (and should!) contribute, but delegates from these teams are expected to pitch in on note taking:
   1. Sales Operations
   1. Field Enablement
   1. Product Marketing
   1. Field Marketing
   1. Sales Dev
   1. Channel
   1. Alliances
1. All sessions will be recorded, so notes taken during QBRs should focus on key takeaways and value-add commentary and conversation. See [Note Taking](/handbook/sales/qbrs/#qbr-note-taking) section below for full note taking guidance.

## QBR Communication
1. QBR-related Slack channels will be created no later than five weeks before the start of QBRs.
   1. The naming will follow this format:
      1. #qbr-comm-qxfyxx
      1. #qbr-ent-qxfyxx
      1. #qbr-channel-qxfyxx
   1. These channels will be used to:
      1. Coordinate asks/reminders for RD/ASM planning action items.
      1. Send reminders about QBR schedules and timing.
      1. Field questions about attendance.
      1. Field logistical questions (i.e. "what's the Zoom link?") that arise as QBRs are in process.
      1. Conduct follow-ups to QBR asks. (i.e. share how/where we have tracked QBR asks and inform the field of the process that will happen next to address them and where to look for updates)
   1. Uses do *not* include:
      1. Facilitate manager approval or feedback for individual reps' QBR decks. This is meant to be handled by managers with their teammates via their own preferred channels.
      1. Make any QBR asks that should be included in reps' decks.
   1. These channels will be archived within 60 days of QBRs being completed.

### QBR Note Taking
The purpose of notes is to capture meaningful insights that come out of the *conversation* during a QBR - questions and answers, feedback, asks, etc. Do not capture verbatim notes or data that is already documented on a slide. The video recording of the meeting will show the slides.

**Q: Who should take notes?**

A: If you are attending as a delegate, please note that it is part of your responsibility to contribute to note-taking in the QBR.

**Q: What specific information should the delegate capture?**

A: In order to serve as an active participant in QBRs, there is no need to take verbatim notes during the sessions.
1. Make as detailed notes as possible *pertaining to asks, action items, or specific improvement requests*. Please include reference to the specific slide in the rep's presentation that pertains to the ask when possible.
1. Capture meaningful insights that come from conversations during the QBR, not information already written in a slide.

**Q: How will the rest of the information be captured?**

A: All QBR hosts are required to record their sessions and provide a link to the recording for the rest of the team and company to access. This reduces the need to take verbatim notes.

### Where to Find Past QBRs
1. A list of all QBR recordings will be housed in a tab on each segment's (ENT, COMM, Channel) schedule spreadsheet.
1. A full list of past QBR presentations can be found in the [QBR Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QAWFYxT2-NzWpOUodepbl0O6zfsMxJGL).

## Field Operations QBR Request Process

### Intake

1. Reps are encouraged to share their top asks for leadership and supporting teams as a part of their QBRs. The asks will be prioritized by segment (ENT & COMM) leadership before being passed off to Sales Ops.
   1. Enterprise Ask Prioritization Process
      1. SAL includes a slide of asks in their QBR presentation
      1. ASMs review all asks for their region holistically upon pre-review of QBR decks and identify a pattern of asks.
         1. ASM-identified top asks will be discussed during their QBR session. Final list of prioritized asks will be passed on to their RD.
      1. RDs will review and prioritize their region's top asks and present them in the ENT Leadership QBR.
      1. RDs and ENT Sales VP will review full list of ENT asks in subsequent RD meeting and will deliver a final list of prioritized ENT asks (no more than 5 asks per functional group) no later than the Monday following the ENT Leadership QBR.
   1. Commercial Ask Prioritization Process
      1. AE includes a slide of asks in their QBR presentation
      1. ASMs review all asks for their region holistically upon pre-review of QBR decks and identify a pattern of asks.
         1. ASM-identified top asks will be discussed during their QBR session to identify a final list of prioritized asks.
      1. ASMs will present their region's top asks in the COMM Leadership QBR.
      1. ASMs and COMM Sales VP will review full list of COMM asks and will deliver a final list of prioritized COMM asks no later than the Monday following the COMM Leadership QBR.
   1. Note that SALs/AEs are not expected to read/dig into each ask as this will primarily be duplicative to the consolidated regaional asks list shared by the ASMs during the sessions. The ASMs are encouraged to discuss any asks that were not included in the final list with the requestor in their 1:1 to determine how/if any action should be taken.
      1. Reps can/should make asks of Field Ops at any time outside of QBRs using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=FieldOpsQBR).
1. Sales Ops provides representative coverage at each QBR, and captures a list of prioritized Sales Asks/Requests (google sheet/notes) with Links to individual QBR presentations.
1. Following each QBR session, prioritized Sales asks are converted to Issues using the [Field-Ops-QBR-Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/issues/new?issuable_template=FieldOpsQBR) Template.
	- Issues opened through above template, will automatically apply the (global) `QBR` label to ensure they’re categorized appropriately for review.

### Execution and Tracking

All new QBR request to the Sales Operations team are tracked and managed as issues within the Sales Operations Project. The [Field Ops QBR Requests board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/boards/1433489?&label_name[]=QBR) tracks the status of these Issues.

If you need more immediate attention please send a message with a link to the issue you created in the `#sales-support` Slack channel.

![Field Ops QBR Request Flow](/handbook/sales/images/SalesOps_QBR_Request_Flow.jpg)

1. **New requests** start with the project label  `SalesOps::New_Request`, which should be auto-assigned if the template was used. Note these should still be **unassigned**.
1. Issues are then moved to `SalesOps::Triage` where they are **triaged** to the correct Sales Ops team (Sales Ops, CS, Deal Desk, Sales Systems), who will determine if there is adequate detail to plan and prioritize the work.
	  - Is the problem statement clear?
	  - Is the impact/value understood?
1. Issues will then be moved to one of the following:
	- `SalesOps::Backlog` - For future scheduling, sequencing, or implementation.
	- `SalesOps::Transferred` - Issues related to teams other than Sales Ops.
	- `SalesOps::Assigned` - for **urgent** requests or quick-wins.
	- `SalesOps::Declined` - in some cases Sales Ops may directly decline the request.
1. From the backlog issues will be moved to:
	- `SalesOps::Assigned` - Issue is assigned to a team member and being executed.
	- `SalesOps::Declined` - If the backlog issue can no longer be accommodated, no longer makes sense to do, etc. it should be moved to declined, and then **closed**.
1. Once **completed**, issues should be moved to `SalesOps::Completed`, and then **closed**.
