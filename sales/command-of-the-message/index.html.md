## Overview

Force Management's definition of Command of the Message is "being audible ready to define your solutions to customers’ problems in a way that differentiates you from your competitors and allows you to charge a premium for your products & services.” Critical sales skills to demonstrate Command of the Message include:
*  Uncover Customer Needs
*  Articulate Value and Differentiation
*  Negotiate Value

## Customer Value Drivers

Value drivers describe what organizations are likely proactively looking for or needing and are top-of-mind customer topics that exist even if GitLab doesn’t. Value drivers may cause buyers to re-allocate discretionary funds, and they support a value-based customer conversation. Organizations adopt and implement GitLab for the following value drivers:
1.  **Increase Operational Efficiencies** - _simplify the software development toolchain to reduce total cost of ownership_
1.  **Deliver Better Products Faster** - _accelerate the software delivery process to meet business objectives_
1.  **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk** - _simplify processes to comply with internal processes, controls and industry regulations without compromising speed_

## GitLab Differentiators

Differentiators can influence a technical buyer's decision criteria in defining the required capabilities for the solution they are seeking. Effective differentiators must be perceived as valuable by the customer and be defensible.

<summary markdown="span">Command of the Message Mantra</summary>

The Mantra is a framework you can use to clearly demonstrate that you have a complete understanding of your customer's goals, needs, and metrics for success. It also provides you with a customer-focused context to transition from the customer's needs which you have clearly articulated into how GitLab helps meet those needs. The Mantra is also a very good meeting prepartion tool to determine how well you know your customer. If you cannot clearly articulate a customer-specific mantra, then you are not ready to progress the deal and you need to do more research. Below is a breakown of the CoM Mantra framework which can be adjusted and articulated in your own words.

*  What I hear you saying Mr./Ms. Customer is that these are the **Positive Business Outcomes** you’re trying to achieve...
*  In order to achieve these positive business outcomes, we agreed that these are the **Required Capabilities** you’re going to need...
*  And you’ll probably want to measure these required capabilities using these **Metrics** 
*  Let me tell you **How We Do It...**
*  Let me tell you **How We Do It Better/Differently...**
*  But don’t take my word for it...**(Proof Points)**

<summary markdown="span">Sharing Feedback</summary>

Over time, the GitLab Value Framework and associated content above will iterate and evolve. To ensure these changes are easily consumable, iterations will be made on a predictable cadence. We will start with a quarterly cadence. 
*  At the start of the last month of a fiscal quarter, Field Enablement will announce a Call for Feedback to solicit input/feedback on suggested iterations and improvements to the GitLab Value Framework and associated content (but feedback may be submitted at any time)
*  To share feedback, submit an issue using [**this issue template**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=value-framework-feedback)  
*  Field Enablement and Product Marketing leadership will review feedback during the middle of the first month of a new quarter. Additional stakeholders and subject matter experts will be pulled in as appropriate.
*  During this review, Field Enablement and Product Marketing will determine the disposition for each issue submitted with three possible outcomes
   1. Accepted (label: `vff::accepted`) - Value Framework feedback that will be actioned on
   1. Deferred (label: `vff::deferred`) - Value Framework feedback that will be deferred until more information is gathered
   1. Declined (label: `vff::declined`) - Value Framework feedback that is declined (no action will be taken)
*  When the `vff::accepted` label is added, a version label will be applied (`ver::1.1`, `ver::1.2`, etc.) to indicate the version of the Value Framework in which the improvement will be implemented
*  When the improvement has been implemented, the `vff::completed` label will be applied 
*  Around the end of the first month of a new quarter, a summarized update of accepted feedback will be shared with the field and implementation of those updates will be tracked in the issues
