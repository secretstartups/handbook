## Overview 
To support and scale GitLab’s continued growth and success, the Field Enablement Team is developing a certification program for Technical Account Managers that includes functional, soft skills, and technical training for field team members.  

Certification badges will align to the customer journey and critical “Moments That Matter” (MTMs) as well as the [field functional competencies](/handbook/sales/training/field-functional-competencies/) that address the critical knowledge, skills, role-based behaviors, processes, content, and tools to successfully execute each MTM.

## Technical Account Managers Curriculum 
The below slide shows the holistic learner journey for TAMs and provides context for the information included throughout the learning program.
