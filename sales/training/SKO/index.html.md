A: We hope to! Sales leadership is looking into opportunities to get the team together in person either by region or with the entire team in 2H FY22. This is contingent on the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will make all decisions with the health and safety of our team members as our top priority.

**Q: What will I be expected to participate in?**

A: SKO is a great opportunity for our team to come together to both celebrate our results and collaborate for a strong start in the new year.
