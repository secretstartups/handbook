# What are Field Functional Competencies? 

GitLab field functional competencies provide a common language and consistent expectations for “what good looks like” for the GitLab field organization (inclusive of Sales and Customer Success roles). They are intended to complement [GitLab’s values](/handbook/values/) and are comprised of specific behaviors that GitLab team members in a field role need to demonstrate consistently to be successful. These critical field skills and behaviors are not meant to be role or job-specific (as each role or job may have additional unique requirements), and how each competency is expressed or demonstrated may vary by role (e.g. by technical depth, engagement in different stages of the customer journey, team-specific expectations, etc.). 

More specifically, functional competencies help to:
*  Guide how GitLab field team members are selected, onboarded, developed, promoted, and rewarded (above & beyond hitting their quota)
*  Build organizational capabilities when adopted and practiced across the field organization
*  Reinforce behavior that is consistent with GitLab’s values and culture
*  Enable GitLab field team members to build productive relationships and generate positive results

There are three primary competencies for the field: Customer Focus, Solution Focus, and Operational Excellence. Please refer to the tables below to learn more.

# Proficiency Levels

Competency proficiency rating levels align with GitLab’s enterprise-wide performance categories:
- [Developing](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#developing)
- [Performing](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#performing)
- [Exceeding](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#exceeding) 

# Practical Application

Field team members and their managers are encouraged to have regular coaching and development conversations to assess individual and team strengths and areas of opportunity across all competencies and the supporting/example skills and behaviors. More specifically, managers in the field organization should:
1. Encourage team members to complete their own self-assessment (see template below) to
    - Identify 2 or more strengths field team members intend to continue to leverage to deliver positive results
    - Identify 2 specific skills / behaviors field team members would like to improve upon
1. In parallel, managers should complete a similar assessment (see template below) for each of his or her direct reports
1. Field team members and their managers should then meet to compare and discuss assessment results then collaboratively brainstorm opportunities and agree on specific plans to support the team member's professional development and ongoing improvement
1. Team members are encouraged to identify and regularly engage with an accountability partner (whether that be their manager and/or other) to maintain focus on development plans and to provide ongoing feedback
