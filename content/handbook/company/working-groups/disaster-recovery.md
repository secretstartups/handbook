### Scope and Definitions

In the context of this working group:

1. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: maximum duration of time in which data might be lost due to an incident.
1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: maximum duration of time that a service is unavailable due to an incident.

### Goals

The working group exists to coordinate the delivery of cross-team efforts that improve both the values and the confidence in our RTO and RPO targets. 

The exit criteria and target goals for the working group are defined [here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/disaster-recovery/) in the internal handbook.
