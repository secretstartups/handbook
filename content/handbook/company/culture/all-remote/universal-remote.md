          %p Welcome to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGfElNsQthay5Dd5OUC9DsNiIl7tzhMW">Universal Remote</a>, GitLab's new weekly web show focused on helping teams transition to a fully remote world. GitLab is the largest all-remote company in the world with over 1,200 team members spanning across 65 countries. Since its inception, GitLab has embraced remote work and now has a dedicated team to foster remote best practices. GitLab is dedicated to helping remote teams succeed. We recently published The Remote Playbook and the Remote Work Report, and the Remote team consults with organizations across industries and geographies to help transition teams to virtual workspaces. The sudden shift to remote work can be challenging, especially given current events, so we'll take 30 minutes each week to help your team work efficiently and make the transition as smooth as possible. We'll uncover the tips, tricks, and insights gleaned from GitLab's long history of remote work and from partners in the industry. Our goal is to make remote content digestible, actionable, and fun.
