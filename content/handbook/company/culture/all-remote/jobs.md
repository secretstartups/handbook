## Introduction

On this page, we're spotlighting all-remote and remote-first companies, along with job boards that curate high-quality remote roles.

We're also curating a growing list of remote communities, where remote leaders and workers can network and share ideas, resources and job opportunities.

## Organizations leading the way

_In the [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) video above, Darren (GitLab) and Rodolphe (Remotive) discuss several remote work topics: favorite things about remote work, how to find/start/thrive in your first remote role, and the impact of the growing remote work community._

Working remotely is becoming more common globally, as supported by data in the [GitLab Remote Work Report](/company/culture/all-remote/remote-work-report/). While all-remote and remote-first organizations still represent the minority, a variety of trends — from heightened rents in major cities to a greater emphasis on sustainability to a cultural desire to work and live where one is most fulfilled — have more people than ever [interested in this way of working](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/).

Buffer's latest [State of Remote Work](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020) shows that the overwhelming majority of those who work remotely would recommend it to others, while [new survey data from Owl Labs](https://www.owllabs.com/blog/remote-work-statistics) collected from 23 countries and 6 continents found that over half of global companies now allow some form of remote work.

Of course, [not all remote environments are created equal](/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/) — a point we cover in detail on the [part-remote page](/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/).

In the aforementioned Owl Labs survey, it found that 16% of global companies are fully remote and 40% of global firms are hybrid, offering remote options while maintaining at least one physical office.

However, an increasing amount of startups and small-to-medium sized businesses are all-remote. In other words, those looking to work for an all-remote or remote-first organization as opposed to lobbying for a remote arrangement within a colocated company will want to cast their attention on career pages from the below.

### Newly remote companies due to COVID-19

COVID-19 served as a catalyst for many companies to become remote-friendly. In turn, an increasing number of organizations are allowing existing employees to work remotely indefinitely/permanently. Below are trackers which publicize which firms have shifted policies to support remote.

Beyond those listed, COVID-19 has democratized the conversation around workplace flexibility. It is now expected for prospective job seekers to inquire about a firm's approach to remote work and flexibility early in the interview process.

## All-remote and remote-first job boards

![GitLab customer illustration](/images/all-remote/gitlab-customer-path.jpg)
{: .medium.center}

Job seekers are wise to point their efforts towards companies that are [built to support 100% remote](/company/culture/all-remote/learning-and-development/). You're able to bypass hours of lobbying for a remote arrangement [during the interview process](/company/culture/all-remote/hiring/), and you're assured that the tools you need to operate effectively from anywhere will be included from the get-go.

While there are myriad job boards that curate part-time and freelance gigs which can be completed from anywhere, this section is focused more on surfacing all-remote and remote-first _careers_.

> "Getting promoted while working remotely really depends on how remote your company is. GitLab is a fully remote organization with over 700 folks around the world, so getting promoted wasn’t difficult at all. In previous roles, I was the only person who worked remotely. In those cases, I felt very forgotten by my employer." - _Emilie L Schario, a Data Engineer at GitLab_

For a better understanding of the nuances, take a look at "[6 People Who Prove You Don’t Have to Sacrifice Your Career to Work Remotely](https://doist.com/blog/remote-career-advice/)" on the Doist blog. Experts from various all-remote and remote-first companies, including [GitLab](/jobs/), [Doist](https://doist.com/), [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/), [DataTrue](https://datatrue.com/), and [Quuu](https://quuu.co/), share their experiences.

## Remote work communities and networking

![GitLab collaboration](/images/all-remote/gitlab-collaboration.jpg)
{: .medium.center}

Staying [connected](/company/culture/all-remote/events/) with remote workers globally is in many ways much easier than staying connected with peers through in-person networking events. Working remotely forces you to be [intentional about everything](/company/culture/all-remote/management/), and the same is true for forming and fostering relationships and becoming part of one or more remote work communities.

As remote work [becomes more common globally](/company/culture/all-remote/remote-work-report/), there are more opportunities than ever to get plugged in, share resources and tips, and exchange job opportunities. Below are several vetted remote communities with high engagement.

1. [Remote-how virtual coworking space](https://remote-how.com/community)
1. [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
    1. [WWR Slack Community](http://bit.ly/wwr_slack)
    1. [WWR Homepage](https://weworkremotely.com/)
    1. [WWR: AMA with Darren Murph, Head of Remote at GitLab](https://weworkremotely.com/ama-with-darren-murph-head-of-remote-at-gitlab#)
1. [Remote Workers in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13657237/) (_private group; all may request admission_)
1. [NoHQ](https://nohq.co/join/)
1. [RemotelyOne](https://www.remotelyone.com/)
1. [CreativeTribes](https://creativetribes.co/)
1. [Women in Technology](https://witchat.github.io/)
1. [Grow Remote](https://growremote.ie/)

## Informal all-remote and remote-first job searching

Keep in mind that many great all-remote and remote-first companies aren't big enough to justify an appearance on conventional job sites. Particularly for startups, hiring is often accomplished via networking and word-of-mouth.

Thus, it's worth a concerted effort to scour [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) (including the [Remote Workers on LI Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13657237/)), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), and [Twitter](http://twitter.com).

Oftentimes, founders will put out [informal](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/) calls for help through a single tweet, Instagram story, or LinkedIn post. These calls do not make it to formal job boards, yet they represent opportunities to join a fledgling company during a formative time when there is potential to secure a significant stake via equity or [stock options](/handbook/stock-options/).

Each of these platforms support search via hashtag. Be aware that many results will be spam, but diligent searchers can find diamonds in the proverbial rough. Here's a [list](https://www.yonder.io/post/best-remote-work-hashtags-social-media) of popular remote work hashtags, including the below. Where you can, combine searches to include the below along with hashtags such as `#hiring` or `#nowhiring`.

1. `#remote`
1. `#remotework`
1. `#futureofwork`
1. `#goremote`
1. `#digitalnomad`
1. `#remoteworking`
1. `#workanywhere`
1. `#virtualteam`
1. `#telecommute`
1. `#locationindependent`

Working in an all-remote environment is unique. Be sure to read over the distinct [benefits](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/) and [drawbacks](/company/culture/all-remote/drawbacks/) when considering if such a setting is ideal for you.
