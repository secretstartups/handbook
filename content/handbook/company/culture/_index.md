## Introduction

Please see our [company page]({{< ref "company" >}}) for more general information about GitLab. You can see how our team has grown at the [GitLab Contribute page.](https://about.gitlab.com/events/gitlab-contribute/)

## Life at GitLab

![GitLab collaboration illustration](/images/all-remote/gitlab-collaboration-illustration.jpg)
{.mx-auto style="max-width: 50%;"}

It’s an exciting time to be part of GitLab. We're a fast-growing, all-remote team, and we're looking for people to join us around the world.
Here's a look at what you can expect from our culture and [all-remote environment]({{< ref "./all-remote/guide" >}}).

### Everyone can contribute

Our size and [our mission]({{< ref "mission#mission" >}}) (that everyone can contribute) mean that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the company.

Because we all use our product internally, you don't have to be a developer to learn to collaborate in the GitLab tool.
From your very first week, no matter your role, you'll gain the technical skills needed to access, question, and contribute to projects far beyond your job description.

This unique approach works because we're a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, the company, and the broader GitLab community succeed.
We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other.

Come prepared to do meaningful work that will help shape the future of the company.

While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like GitLab, they may not be clearly defined.
You'll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to try something new.

### Freedom to iterate

At GitLab, our [value of iteration]({{< ref "values#iteration" >}}) has a unique impact on the way we operate and get things done.

Working this way means our team members are expected to quickly deliver the minimum viable change in their work instead of waiting to produce a polished, completed product.

While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it's liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster.

As our company and the industry continue to grow, you'll have the freedom to change and constantly evolve everything from your schedule and your workspace to your job description and your skills.

### All-remote work

{{< youtube "eIs71f5IEUU?start=468" >}}

*In the above [interview](https://youtu.be/eIs71f5IEUU) with [Stuart Miniman](https://twitter.com/stu) of [theCUBE](https://www.thecube.net/), GitLab CEO and co-founder Sid Sijbrandij discusses the merits of operating a 100% remote organization, and why he believes it's the future of work.*

> At GitLab, we're figuring out a lot of things you have to do to be all-remote, and we're trying to share those lessons. That's anything from working [handbook-first]({{< ref "handbook-usage#why-handbook-first" >}}) to [communication styles]({{< ref "./all-remote/effective-communication" >}}) and being intentional about [informal communication]({{< ref "./all-remote/informal-communication" >}}).
>
> If you Google "*GitLab all-remote*", you'll find tons of tips. And those are based not just on what we say, but what we *do*. We have a public [handbook]({{< ref "/handbook" >}}) of over 3000 pages with all our internal processes. You can check out what we really do to make this work.
>
> I think it's going to be the future. In the future, companies who make digital products are going to be much more all-remote. And we want to [enable that trend]({{< ref "remote-vision" >}}). We think it's great for [team members]({{< ref "./all-remote/people" >}}).

GitLab is one of the world's largest all-remote companies, and being a part of our team offers unique advantages beyond the requisite flexibility you'll find in many organizations.

As a GitLab team member, you can work from anywhere with good internet. Whether you're an adventurer looking to travel the world while still pursuing your career,
a parent or caregiver who wants a job that allows you to spend more time with family, or somewhere in between, you'll have the freedom to contribute when and where you do your best work.

But there's more to our all-remote culture than the daily flexibility it provides.
By nature, having no offices or headquarters makes us more inclusive, more transparent, and more efficient in everything we do.
With a team spread across over 65 countries around the globe, we invite diverse perspectives, we document everything, and we collaborate asynchronously.

Despite all of its benefits for team members, our company, and the world, remote work isn't for everyone.

## Culture at GitLab

![GitLab values](/images/all-remote/gitlab-values-tanukis.jpg)
{.mx-auto style="max-width: 50%;"}

Culture at GitLab is composed of three things.

1. [GitLab Values]({{< ref "values" >}})
1. Camaraderie (mutual trust and friendship). This is created and maintained by [informal communication](.{{< ref "./all-remote/informal-communication" >}}/. We also build trust by [effectively collaborating]({{< ref "values#dont-let-each-other-fail" >}}) with others.
1. Work style (how we work). This is defined and articulated in our [communication guide]({{< ref "communication" >}}) and [handbook usage guide]({{< ref "handbook-usage" >}}).

In other organizations, culture may be defined through the *personality of the group*. This includes people who have traits in common and people who you enjoy spending time with. Note that this is not something that should matter when [evaluating people for work]({{< ref "#culture-fit-is-a-bad-excuse" >}}), and this is not what we mean with Culture at GitLab.

Some key takeaways from the call include:

1. Culture isn't preserved. Instead, it evolves. Every team member can contribute to and iterate on the company culture.
1. It's important to scale communication as companies grow to accommodate different learning styles, communities, and team member expectations.
1. Culture shouldn't look at roles or levels in the company. There’s no way for a company to dictate a culture from the top down. If you manage to build up this sense of belonging in everyone in the company, it builds up resilience.

Over the course of many trips he learned that cattle are docile, mostly... but don't turn your backon them because they can't be outrun!" %}}
