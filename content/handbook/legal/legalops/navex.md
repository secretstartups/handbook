## Best Practices for Using Navex

For the best user experience, we recommend using Google Chrome and disabling your pop-up blocker, as Navex courses will launch in a separate window. If your course freezes or becomes stuck, follow these best practices:

- Save and close the course.
- Expand the course player to the full screen size.
- Toggle the zoom, making sure it is set to no greater than 100%.
- Clear your cache.
- Make sure you have logged into Navex in only one tab/window.
- Restart your computer. 

If you are experiencing course completion issues, follow these best practices:

- Ensure your internet connection is stable.
- Don't leave the course unattended without input (i.e., running in the background).
- Close out of the course prior to changing networks, docking/undocking computers, locking your computer, stepping away from your computer, or completing other work (use the internal course 'x' as opposed to the main window 'x').

If you continue to experience difficulties or have questions, ask for help in the`#compliance-training` Slack channel.
