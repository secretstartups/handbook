The Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) [Team](/job-families/legal-and-corporate-affairs/environmental-social-governance/) creates and maintains GitLab's Corporate Sustainability strategy and programs. This includes ESG disclosures and public ESG reporting, identifying and prioritizing key issues to advance GitLab's social and environmental goals, and creating partnerships with nonprofit organizations that support GitLab's values and mission.

## ESG Strategy

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, although newly formalized in GitLab Inc.'s ("GitLab", "we", "our") strategy, have been embedded into our work culture since our inception. Deeply integrated into our business philosophy, GitLab's ESG strategy is driven by our [values](/handbook/values/) of Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency (CREDIT).

In December 2022, we conducted an ESG materiality assessment to determine which ESG topics are most important to our business and our stakeholders. Through engagement with both internal and external stakeholders, we explored which ESG topics have the greatest impact on GitLab's business, and where we have the potential to have the greatest impact on the environment, society, and our global communities. Our materiality matrix was finalized in January 2023.

Every year GitLab publishes an annual ESG report where we share our approach to managing our key ESG focus areas, provide updates on programs and policies, achievements to date, metrics and targets and plans for the future.

#### GiveLab

GiveLab is GitLab's Team Member Volunteer Program. The GiveLab Program lives under the [ESG Team](/job-families/legal-and-corporate-affairs/environmental-social-governance/) and is a part of GitLab's overall [ESG strategy](/handbook/legal/esg/#esg-strategy) and program development. The term GiveLab encompasses all Team Member Volunteering initiatives at GitLab.

GitLab encourages team members to take part in volunteer initiatives that support their local communities, participate in virtual volunteer activities, and organize volunteer activities as part of team events and get togethers.

Team members may self organize volunteer events at any point throughout the year. To submit a request for a team volunteer activity with a [Registered Nonprofit Organization](/handbook/legal/philanthropy-policy/#who-we-support) that isn't on the current [GiveLab Nonprofit Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1koFKQbKqm4jpKtZlteLDTPM3HYv20nffXaqRJ2C8YBA/edit?gid=0#gid=0), please go to the [Philanthropic Requests epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2145) and open a new issue using the [Volunteer_Support Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/new?issuable_template=volunteer_support).

Team members can also request support from the ESG Team to organize local or virtual volunteer opportunities on their behalf by going to the [Philanthropic Requests epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2145) and opening a new issue using the [Volunteer_Support Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/new?issuable_template=volunteer_support). Please write "yes" for the question, "Would you like the ESG team's help organizing the volunteer activity?"

All team members and volunteer activities must adhere to the [GitLab Philanthropy Policy](/handbook/legal/philanthropy-policy/). Team members must follow GitLab's paid time off (PTO) policy if volunteering during work hours and use the "public service/volunteer" option in Workday.

If volunteering in person, team members may incur some expenses. For calendar year 2024, team members can expense up to a total of $25 for expenses incurred that meet the allowed for reimbursement criteria. All expenses should be submitted in Navan using the "GiveLab" classification. Please note that GitLab does not allow team members to travel to in-person volunteer events. All in-person volunteering should be local to the team member.

As with all [company expenses](/handbook/finance/expenses/#1-policy), team members must be thoughtful in spending the company's money and use best judgment to ensure that all expenses are deemed "ordinary and necessary." Team members should follow all [team member expense responsibilities](/handbook/finance/expenses/#2-responsibilities).

Expenses allowed for reimbursement (for in-person volunteer events):

- Local travel only -  [mileage](/handbook/finance/expenses/#mileage), [train](/handbook/finance/expenses/#train), [taxi/rideshares](/handbook/finance/expenses/#transportationparking). Must follow and comply with the current limits of our Expense Policy. Code under their individual travel category and use the "GiveLab" classification in Navan

- [Meal](handbook/finance/expenses/#meals-company-provided-while-traveling) during the event.  Must follow and comply with the current limits of our Expense Policy.  Code under Travel-Meals for Myself and use the "GiveLab" classification in Navan

Expenses not allowed for reimbursement:

- Any airfare, lodging, rental cars, coworking space, internet expenses are not allowed
- Any supplies or items needed for the event
- Donations to the nonprofit
- Any expenses that are not mentioned as "allowed" above are not reimbursable and there will be no exceptions

## GiveLab 30 Days of Impact

GiveLab 30 Days of Impact is GitLab’s first annual volunteer campaign created to encourage team members to foster connections, build trust among one another and embody our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities. We have designed this program with our high-performing team culture and results for customers in mind.

GiveLab 30 days of Impact will run from 2024-11-12 through 2024-12-12 and our goal is to encourage as many team members as possible to volunteer over the course of 30 days.

Throughout the month, team members can volunteer as little as one hour of their time to make an impact. We understand that our team members are driven by many different factors, and we welcome that volunteer participation will look different for everyone. Through GiveLab 30 days of Impact we aim to offer many different ways for team members to get involved such as:

- Through company-sponsored virtual events
- Local in-person volunteer events organized by the GitLab ESG team, [GiveLab Champions](/handbook/legal/esg/#givelab-champions), and team members
- Individual volunteer pursuits
- Find and contribute to opportunities in the [GiveLab Volunteer Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1koFKQbKqm4jpKtZlteLDTPM3HYv20nffXaqRJ2C8YBA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Include a volunteer activity at an all-hands or team builder

### Why GiveLab 30 Days of Impact Exists

While GitLab encourages year-round volunteerism through [GiveLab](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/esg/#givelab), GiveLab 30 days of Impact centralizes our efforts into an annual campaign to have a larger collective impact over a specific timeframe. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for [boosting engagement](https://bc-ccc.uberflip.com/i/1510320-community-involvement-study-2023-executive-summary/0?_gl=1%2An3v02c%2A_ga%2ANzYwODcyNTg5LjE3Mjc3MTEzNzY.%2A_ga_50520H9ZLC%2AMTcyOTA1NTM1MC4yLjEuMTcyOTA1NTQyNS4wLjAuMA..), improving employee retention, and [strengthening relationships at work](https://blog.catchafire.org/5-corporate-volunteering-stats-you-should-know#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%2080%25%20of,enhances%20the%20overall%20work%20culture).
Additionally, this program offers volunteering opportunities around a major holiday season in many parts of the world, a time when many are seeking opportunities to give back.

### Team Member Benefits of Volunteerism

During this volunteer event, The Red Cross will guide volunteers through mapping an area of need within a live group virtual setting. No special skills are necessary and a brief training will be provided during the volunteer session.

### Organize a volunteer activity for an all-hands or team builder

Please open [an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/new?issuable_template=volunteer_support) and reach out to April Skeete in the #givelab slack channel

### Volunteer independently

Many of you already volunteer in your community and we want to capture how you make an impact. If you already utilize PTO to volunteer, follow the instructions on requesting time off and adding ‘volunteer time’ as the reason and join the #givelab slack channel to share your story!

### Contribute to GitLab’s OSS codebase

At GitLab, our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. This, together with our values, is at the core of how we manage our business, including our approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance and our ESG programs such as GiveLab.

Contributors to GitLab — the platform and the company — make up the GitLab community and are fundamental to GitLab’s strategy and mission. Team members who wish to volunteer their time contributing to GitLab help live our mission and contribute to the open source community.

### Acceptable Volunteer Activities

All GitLab volunteer activities must support registered nonprofit organizations that align with our values and our GitLab [Philanthropy Policy](/handbook/legal/philanthropy-policy/). A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal, or national government.

### Utilizing GitLab’s PTO Policy to Volunteer

Team member participation is voluntary, should not interfere with work commitments, and time off is required to be in alignment with GitLab’s [PTO policy](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/). Travel is not permitted for this program. Team Members may choose to volunteer virtually or through local in-person events. Volunteer events typically last between one and four hours.
Managers play an important role in supporting team members in taking time for themselves and their families, while also ensuring accountability to results and coverage for teams and its goals. Our Results for Customers value sits at the top of our values hierarchy, and our PTO policy  empowers managers to appropriately manage workloads and deliverables, while also giving team members the time away they need from work.

### How to Request Volunteer Time Off

Team Members taking time off to volunteer should communicate time off in advance with their manager. To request volunteer time off, follow the [Paid Time Off](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#paid-time-off) procedures outlined in our handbook and reach out to People Connect via HelpLab should you have any concerns. A step-by-step guide on how to request paid time off can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZvTbPfvCOHDqA9riifMNNN0wsZyaxIql14cj_M5TK8/edit?tab=t.0). Note that when following along with this guide, during “Step 8” there is a section listed as “Reasons”, and here you should select “Volunteer Time Off” from the dropdown options. Note that at this time, entering your paid time off requests labeled as “Volunteer Time Off” can only be completed by submitting your request within Workday, and not the Workday Slack App.

### Expenses and Reimbursements for Participation

Please see our [GiveLab reimbursement policy](/handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/esg/#givelab) to understand current allowances as they relate to volunteering costs.

### Contributing Feedback for This Program

Surveys will be sent to team members following their volunteer participation and we additionally welcome all feedback around this volunteer program as we aim to continue improving GiveLab 30 Days of Impact following the first iteration.

We appreciate the internal stakeholders who have provided initial input to include relevant program considerations such as the People Team, PBPs, Finance, DIB & TMRGs and EBAs. Additionally, we’ll continue to incorporate considerations from our GiveLab Champions, who sit within various departments across the company.

## In Kind Support

**GitLab for Nonprofits**

[GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/) is an in-kind donation program that provides licenses and seats at no cost to eligible Registered Nonprofit Organizations.

GitLab for Nonprofits operates on a first come first served basis. Once the [annual donation of 5,000 seats](/handbook/legal/philanthropy-policy/#2-in-kind-product-donation) is met, the application will remain closed for the year.

**FAQs**

**What are the benefits of the GitLab for Nonprofits program?**

GitLab is a single platform for project management, collaboration, source control management, git, automation, security, and much more. Because it is easy to use, flexible, and all in one place, it is the best choice for nonprofits to scale their work. The GitLab for Nonprofits Program gives free licenses of GitLab to registered nonprofit organizations.

Nonprofits accepted into the program will be provided a free Ultimate license for one year (SaaS or self-managed) for up to 20 seats. Additional seats may be requested although they may not be granted.

**Who qualifies for the program?**

GitLab supports Registered 501c3 (or jurisdictional equivalent) Nonprofit Organizations in good standing that align with our [Values](/handbook/values/). A "Registered Nonprofit Organization" is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal or national government.

GitLab prioritizes Registered Nonprofit Organizations that help advance GitLab's social and environmental key topics that were defined in GitLab's [2022 materiality assessment](/handbook/legal/esg/). GitLab's current social and environmental key topics are:

- Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
- Talent Management & Engagement
- Climate Action and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

For the calendar year 2024, we will limit the in-kind program to 5,000 seats, which was approved by finance and the board in the [Philanthropy Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b40Z-5uVebZ05RQehn5qq86c2qP_0w8T40MrygP3VEU/edit). Each organization will be eligible for up to 20 seats. This will allow us to assist as many organizations as possible. This will be revisited throughout the year and adjusted as needed. Interested organizations who are new customers may request additional seats although the request may not be granted. To limit churn, current GitLab customers that apply to transition to the Nonprofit Program will not be granted a special request above the 20 seats.

**What are the terms of the GitLab for Nonprofits program?**

Upon acceptance, program members are subject to the [GitLab Subscription Agreement](/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/). The decision to issue a GitLab for Nonprofits license is always at the sole discretion of GitLab.

**How does someone apply?**

Interested organizations need to visit the [GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/) page and submit the [application form](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/join/#nonprofit-program-application).

**How are applications processed?**

1. Nonprofits apply on the [GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/join/#nonprofit-program-application) page. Once the application is submitted, the Nonprofit will receive a message and a link to TechSoup, our verification partner.
2. The Nonprofit will then need to log in or create their TechSoup account. TechSoup provides a rigorous vetting process to ensure the nonprofit is eligible for the GitLab for Nonprofits program and meets all requirements.
3. If a Nonprofit is verified, TechSoup will notify GitLab.
4. GitLab will then undergo its own vetting and approval process.
5. Once all parties have verified and approved the Nonprofit, GitLab will send the instructions directly to the Nonprofit to redeem their license.
6. If a Nonprofit is not verified through TechSoup, TechSoup will provide details on how the Nonprofit can become verified.
7. If a Nonprofit is declined from GitLab, GitLab will notify the Nonprofit via nonprofits@GitLab.com.
8. Please allow up to 15 business days for the application and verification process.

To learn more about ESG at GitLab, please take our ESG Training course available on [LevelUp](https://levelup.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https://levelup.gitlab.com/learn/course/esg-training) and in the [Handbook](/handbook/legal/esg/ESG-Training/).

## Measuring Results

Disclosing our progress through data aligns with our [Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) and [Results](/handbook/values/#results) values. We have a section in our Handbook devoted to [Key Performance Indicators](/handbook/company/kpis/) (KPIs) where we update our progress regularly. Every part of GitLab has KPIs linked to the company Objectives and Key Results [(OKRs)](/handbook/company/okrs/). As we build our ESG strategy, we will continue to add and update relevant ESG KPIs to the handbook.

**Q: Is GitLab certified as a diverse supplier?**

A: GitLab is a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: GTLB) and is not defined as a diverse supplier and is unable to be certified as such, accordingly. Nevertheless, diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIB) is a [core value](/handbook/values/) at GitLab. On a daily basis, we strive to keep our operations, employment practices, and supplier selection in line with [this value](/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/). GitLab's [DIB team](/job-families/people-group/diversity-inclusion-partner/) builds an environment where all team members feel a [sense of belonging](/job-families/people-group/diversity-inclusion-partner/), which results in a truly inclusive and welcoming work environment. Moreover, GitLab's Procurement team selects potential suppliers with [responsible sourcing and diversity](/handbook/finance/procurement/) in mind.

**Q: Does GitLab sponsor/fund nonprofit organizations?**

A: Through the corporate philanthropy program, GitLab supports registered 501c3 (or country equivalent) nonprofit organizations in good standing that align with our [Values](/handbook/values/). A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal, or national government.

GitLab prioritizes financial contributions to organizations that align with our values, support our environmental and social goals, and help us advance our mission to make it so that everyone can contribute. We endeavor to build long-term partnerships with community organizations and avoid a transactional approach to our corporate giving. Our current social and environmental focus areas are:

- Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
- Talent Management
- Climate Action

Monetary contributions are initiated by the request of our team members and TMRGs, and the process can be reviewed [here](/handbook/legal/esg/#monetary-contributions).

A: Through [GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/), GitLab donates up to 5,000 seats annually to Registered Nonprofit Organizations. Interested Registered Nonprofit Organizations are required to apply and will be vetted for registration and standing status. Licenses are donated on a first come first serve basis and the number of seats to be donated within a fiscal year is reviewed annually by the ESG Team, the FP&A Business Partner, and Chief Legal Officer. Please review our [Nonprofit program application](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/join/#nonprofit-program-application) for further details.
