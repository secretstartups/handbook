## Preparing for the program

### Confidentiality

Participating in the shadow program is a privilege where you will be exposed to confidential information. This is underpinned by trust in the shadows to honor the confidentiality of topics being discussed and information shared. The continuation of this program is entirely dependent on shadows past, present, and future honoring this trust placed in them.

### Consider adding goals

Develop goals for your time as a SA People Leader Shadow. To make your goals more actionable, you may want to use the [SMART goals framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm).

### Coffee chat with SA People Leaders

Before your scheduled rotation, try to schedule coffee chats with a few SA people leaders before you start the program. This gives you the opportunity to get to know them before the rotation.

Use this coffee chat to express to them your interest in people leadership as well as to seek advice / feedback on your goals.
