title: Govern Stage
---

The Govern engineering groups are responsible for the [Govern Stage](/handbook/product/categories/#govern-stage) of the product.

## Vision

Help users manage security vulnerabilities, policies, and compliance across their organization.

The stage vision is captured on the [Govern product direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/) pages.

## Groups

- [Anti-abuse](anti-abuse/)
- [Authentication](authentication/)
- [Authorization](authorization/)
- [Compliance](compliance/)
- [Security Policies](security-policies/)
- [Threat Insights](threat-insights/)

## Priorities

Group priorities are reviewed collaboratively with product counterparts and published on the Govern direction pages

- [Anti-abuse](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/anti-abuse/#priorities)
- [Authentication](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/authentication/#priorities)
- [Authorization](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/authorization/#priorities)

## Skills

Because we have a wide range of domains to cover, it requires a lot of different expertise and skills:

| Technology skills | Areas of interest    |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Ruby on Rails     | Backend development  |
| Go                | Backend development  |
| Vue, Vuex         | Frontend development |
| GraphQL           | _Various_            |
| SQL (PostgreSQL)  | _Various_            |

## Engineering Managers

We meet bi-weekly synchronously to discuss stage and group wide topics. We primarily try to use Epics/Issues to initiate discussions and maintain transparency. We use the
[Govern Compartment Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/govern-compartment/-/boards/4833026) to better organize our discussions.

### Engineering Leadership - Backup Plans and Escalation


The following table lists the Govern Stage management [backup plan](/handbook/engineering/management/#engineering-manager-backup).

Team members should contact any Govern Engineering Manager by mentioning in `#sd_govern_engineering` or `#sec-growth-development-people-leaders` if they need management support for a problem that arises, such as a production incident or feature change lock, when their direct manager is not available. The Govern manager can provide guidance and coordination to ensure that the team member receives the appropriate help.

The Engineering Manager will allocate open issues and merge requests to another engineer, ideally in the same [group](#all-team-members), if an engineer is absent.

Some people management tasks, including [Workday](/handbook/people-group/workday/workday-guide) and [Navan Expense](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide), may require for escalation or delegation.

In the event that one or more team members become unavailable for any reason, this can serve as the foundation for a business continuity plan (BCP) and serve as a basic guide for Managing Engineering continuity.

## Weekly updates

The Govern development teams provide [weekly status updates](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2126) using an issue template and CI scheduled job.
As priorities change, engineering managers update the template to include areas of interest.

An example template highlighting priorities, opportunities, risks, and security and availability concerns is:

Weekly update template can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/govern-compartment/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/govern_stage_weekly_update.md).

## Quarterly review updates

Every quarter, an engineering manager for each group in the Govern and Growth Compartment prepares the quarterly review update using the issue template and records approximately 5 minutes to summarize the last quarter from the engineering perspective and present a high-level plan for the group for the next one to respond to quarterly Product strategy and explain our goals for next quarter.

We aim to foster collaboration and communication between engineering managers in the Govern and Growth Compartment, align groups on product priorities for the next quarter, and celebrate our successes together.

Quarterly review update template can be found [here](Weekly update template can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/govern-compartment/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/govern_stage_quarterly_review.md)).

## Govern staff meeting

The Govern stage engineering department leaders meet every two weeks to discuss stage and group topics in the `Govern and Growth staff meeting`,
and optionally every week in the `Expansion Development` staff  and `Sec Growth senior leaders development` staff meetings.

Meetings have an agenda and are async-first, where the aim is to resolve discussions async and leave time in the meeting to deep dive into topics that require more discussion.
