## Vision

The Duo Workflow group is focused on developing GitLab Duo Workflow, an AI system to automate tasks and help increase productivity in your development workflow.

### Team Members

**Engineering Manager & Engineers**

{{< team-by-manager-slug "bastirehm" >}}

**Product, Design & Quality**

### ‚òéÔ∏è How to reach us

Depending on the context here are the most appropriate ways to reach out to the IDE Group:

* Slack Channel: `#g_duo_workflow`
* Slack Groups: `@duo-workflow` (entire team) and `@duo-workflow-engs` (just engineers)

## üì¶ Team Processes

### üìÜ Regular team meetings

**‚ùóÔ∏èImportant**: For every meeting, the [AI Framework team's meeting document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15N9G3UWoB_u8KOErdk_aGk5IdBoxEFBWMSgg9FvwVXo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.j3rcm4sf2nc9) should be used, and filled with the meeting notes, as well as references to any other sync meeting agendas/notes/recordings which have recently occurred. This will make it easier for people to find any meeting notes.

#### Team Meetings

1. **Duo Workflow Meeting**
   * **When:** Every Monday, 15:00 UTC and every Wednesday 7:00 UTC
   * **What:** This meeting serves as a general sync meeting to bring up any current issues and blockers. We walk the board at least once a week on an alternating basis between the meetings to ensure clarity around current progress and priorities

### Shared calendars

* AI-Powered Stage Calendar (Calendar ID: `c_n5pdr2i2i5bjhs8aopahcjtn84@group.calendar.google.com`)

### üìö Duo Workflow Board Outline

The Duo Worklflow team is following a kanban-like process. All currently prioritized issues are visualized in our [kanban board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/7828018?label_name[]=Category%3ADuo%20Workflow&milestone_title=Started&label_name[]=group%3A%3Aduo%20workflow). The issues are assigned to the current milestone to differentiate them from unprioritized ones. This does not indicate a commitment to actually deliver them in this milestone but only the intent to work on the issue soon.

1. **workflow::refinement**: Issues in this stage have been identified as important to be worked on but are not ready for development yet. This might be due to a variety of reasons such as missing or not finished designs or architectural questions that need to be clarified.
2. **workflow::ready for development**: Issues that are ready for implementation are moved to this list.
3. **workflow::in dev**: When a developer begins work on an issue, they should move it to this list.
4. **workflow::in review**: After development is complete and submitted to be reviewed, the issue should be moved to this list.
5. **workflow::verification**: Following a successful code and UX review, the issue should be moved to this list and the "verification" label should be applied.
6. **Closed**: Once the issue is verified and confirmed to be working properly, it should be moved to this list, the "complete" label should be applied, and the issue should be closed.

## üëè Communication

The Duo Workflow Team communicates based on the following guidelines:

1. Always prefer async communication over sync meetings.
1. Don't shy away from arranging a [sync call](#-ad-hoc-sync-calls) when async is proving inefficient, however always record it to share with team members.
1. By default communicate in the open.
1. All work-related communication in Slack happens in the `#g_duo_workflow` channel.

### ‚è≤ Time Off

Team members should add any [planned time off](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#paid-time-off) in the "Workday" slack app, so that the Engineering Manager is aware of PTO and can plan accordingly.

### ü§ô Ad-hoc sync calls

We operate using async communication by default. There are times when a sync discussion can be beneficial and we encourage team members to schedule sync calls with the required team members as needed.
