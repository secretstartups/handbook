title: "Cells"

description: "This is the handbook page for the Cells project. Cells is one of the top priorities for FY2025, with the goal of providing additional scalability for GitLab.com. This handbook page contains the project information such as the project plan, roadmap, workstreams, DRIs, stakeholders, and communication channels. It also has links to important documentation such as the Cells design blueprints."

## Intro

Cells is a new architecture for our software as a service platform. This architecture is horizontally scalable, resilient, and provides a more consistent user experience. It may also provide additional features in the future, such as data residency control (regions) and federated features.

For more information about the goals of Cells, see [goals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/cells/goals.html).

## Program Planning and Tracking

All Cells 1.0 work is tracked under the [Cells 1.0 Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12383). We also have a planning [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1h99JKDuNJbfv46rFniCGg0Z0Mgm1QA8OyuSGxosFo/edit#gid=0) that provides a high level program structure and timelines (for planning purpose only).

   - Production system with No customer data. We have an environment that covers testing needs of Test Platform and Development teams.
   - Entering criteria: A cell is brought up so that development teams and Infra teams have an environment to test their changes, Test platform team has a place to run different kind of tests, including E2E, automation test and etc.
   - Exit criteria: All the application feature gaps are filled, a Cell is provisioned using the cells lifecycle automation tools, and we run our existing E2E tests on Cells as part of our deployment pipeline
1. First Production Cell - Beta

   - We have a production instance that an internal or external customer can do functional and performance test on
   - Entering criteria: Exit criteria of Experiment milestone
   - Exit criteria: Customer discovered issues are addressed, we meet our GA requirements
1. First Production Cell - General Availability
   - label: [cells-1.0-milestone::GA](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=cells-1.0-milestone%3A%3Aga&first_page_size=20)

   - Enable organization FF on Cell 3
   - Move the internal customer to Cell 3 with Direct Transfer

### Work Estimation

We use t-shirt sizing to estimate the time and effort needed to deliver issues/epics. Sizes are not meant to be viewed as precise estimations or timeline commitments. Rather, these sizes help us identify risk areas and opportunities for cutting scope. Sizes map to the following definitions:

| Size   | Time       |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Tiny   | 1-2 weeks  |
| Small  | 1 month    |
| Medium | 3 months   |
| Large  | 6 months   |
| XXL    | > 6 months |
