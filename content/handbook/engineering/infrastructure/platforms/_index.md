## Mission

The Infrastructure Platforms section enables GitLab Engineering to build and deliver **safe**, **scalable** and **efficient** features for multi-tenant and single-tenant GitLab SaaS platforms (GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated).

## Vision

To deliver on the mission, we are in the process of formalising the building blocks we need to work on.

## Direction

In FY25, teams in the Platforms Section of the Infrastructure Department have collaborated on [the "North Star"](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/1097), which is then used to set [the SaaS Platforms Strategy](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2243).

Initiatives driven within the Platforms section, often spanning multiple quarters, are represented on the [SaaS Platforms section epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2115).

## How we work

### Communication

We collaborate on the section level items in the [#s_platforms](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02D1HQRTKQ) Slack channel. This channel is used to share important information with the wider team, but also serves to align all teams in Platfroms with the common topic.

For communication between managers, we have [#g_saas_platforms_leads](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C010QV6RRB3) channel. Everyone interested is welcome to join this channel if they find the topics interesting. We also have [a confidential managers channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/G010N73CXJ6) that is used to discuss staffing issues affecting all teams that require additional coordination.

Once per week, we hold a `Platforms leads call` to align on action items related to career development, general direction or answer any ongoing questions that have not been addressed async. The call is cancelled when there are no topics added on the morning of the call.

In addition to the `Platforms leads call`, we have some recurring events and reminders that can be viewed in the [SaaS Platforms Leadership Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y184YTgxZjdhY2M3NmQ3MmI4ZTQxODlhNjFmN2EyN[…]MzIzNmY1OTJlN2RkNTJlODNiQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Please add this to your Calendars to stay up-to-date with the various events.

The Director of Product and Director of Infrastructure for SaaS Platforms conduct weekly progress reviews. During `Platforms Grand Review`, they review [progress across all groups](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2115) with the goals of being informed of progress made, learning about existing blockers, and supporting the team. The review is private streamed to the GitLab Unfiltered channel because the review covers confidential issues. All recordings are made available in the [Platforms Grand Review YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KqDXSHdlUvPWHOj_Hw8JdQ1).

### Project and Backlog Management

### Tools

The Platforms section builds and maintains various tools to help deploy, operate and monitor our SaaS platforms. You can view a list of these tools in the [Platforms Tools Index](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/tools/).

### OKR

We use objective and key results to set goals in alignment with [OKRs at GitLab](handbook/company/okrs/).
[Our OKR process](handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/okrs/) is shared between all teams in Saas Platforms.

### Hiring

[Our hiring process](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/hiring/) is shared between all teams in SaaS Plaforms.
