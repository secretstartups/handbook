## Support I Don't Know (IDK)

The Support I Don't Know (IDK) is a glossary for acronyms Support Engineers may encounter during daily work in 
Slack, Support Team GitLab issues, tickets, etc. Entries are alphabetically sorted and should link to or include a definition
source when possible.

The IDK was inspired by [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/6327),
with the goal of providing definitions for terms encountered by support. This
also aligns with handbook style item [acronyms and initialisms](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/content-style-guide/#acronyms-and-initialisms).

If you came to this page while reading a document missing a definition, be a
helpful Tanuki and update that page with the acronym expansion.
