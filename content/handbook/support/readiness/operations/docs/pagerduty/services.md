## What are Pagerduty services

As per
[Pagerduty](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations):

> A technical service reflects a discrete piece of functionality that is wholly
> owned by one team. One or more technical services combine to deliver
> customer-facing or business capabilities.

Services interact with `/chatops oncall` commands to display who is currently
on-call in Slack.

#### Labels to use

For all issues and MRs involving Pagerduty fields, the label
`Support-Ops-Category::Pagerduty` should be used.

#### Change criticality

Due to wildly varying nature and impact adding/editing/deleting things in
Pagerduty can impose, all issues/MRs related to Pagerduty need
to have the their criticality

## Notes

As part of PagerDuty's Slack V2 integration, all services now include Trigger an incident in PagerDuty from the Slack command line by typing "/pd trigger" by default.

Services listed here that show Slack under their listed integrations are also using the legacy slash command integration.
