## Global Support working with ASEs

INTRODUCTORY TEXT HERE

## Contributing to ASE tickets

### New non-emergency tickets

<!-- This is not true for all accounts currently, and may also change for the future.
     Change this to discuss how to determine whether and how to help on ASE account
     tickets. -->

All new non-emergency tickets from a customer that paid for an Assigned
Support Engineer (ASE)
[will be automatically assigned to that ASE](../customer-onboarding.html#auto-assign-the-customers-tickets).

See [what to do when the ASE is unavailable](#when-the-ase-is-unavailable) and
[what to do if they came in requesting a different region](#tickets-in-a-different-region).

### New emergency tickets

Regardless of when an emergency request is submitted by an ASE's account,
the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals.html)
for the emergency is the on-call Support Engineer. The only process change is
that they should **notify the ASE**. The best way to do this is simply to ping
the ASE's Slack handle in the emergency's Slack thread. After that, the on-call
engineer should work the emergency in the normal way.

Guidance for ASEs regarding emergencies from their accounts can be found on the
[ASE emergencies page](../emergencies.html)

### Pre-ASE tickets

Tickets that predate the introduction of an ASE for an account are treated a
little differently because of their individual histories. Let the customer
decide who they'd like to work on this problem with - the existing assignee or
the ASE. If they'd like the ASE to own it, then the current assignee and the ASE
should communicate with each other so the ASE knows the history of the problem
handled in the ticket, the customer's expectations, and anything else the current
assignee would find useful to share.

### When the ASE is unavailable

An ASE can be unavailable for a variety of reasons such as being off or having
a different Support priority at the moment. When that happens and you notice a
ticket of theirs that will breach or was missed, feel free to respond to that
ticket yourself, but be sure to leave the ASE as the assignee and `cc`
yourself until they return. Upon their return, they'll take the ticket.

### Tickets in a different region

Tickets in a different region will still get assigned to the ASE. If they'll
breach before the ASE gets online then that means
[the ASE is unavailable so follow this process](#when-the-ase-is-unavailable).
