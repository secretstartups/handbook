## Account Teams working with ASEs

- the importance of the ASE kickoff meeting
  - we aren't guest speakers, we're featured
  - please let us introduce ourselves and our service
- be careful not to label us
- let us answer questions about what we can or can't do, and will or won't do
- should we attend your meetings? sometimes
- please have our back - if the customer is upset, stand up for us and then come tell us what's up
