### Logs and Performance

|      |       |
|:----:| ----- |
|Self-managed| [GitlabSOS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/gitlabsos) is a great way to gather all logs from a customer instance in order to investigate further on potential issues.<br/>Similar to GitLabSOS, use [KubeSOS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/kubesos) if your customer uses Kubernetes instead of source or omnibus installations.<br/>[Fast-stats](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/fast-stats) is a great way to compare performance analytics from and between GitLab Logs.<br/>[Green-hat](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/greenhat)  is an experimental SOS and log parser.|
|DotCom|[Kibana](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/) provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster to find Web based queries. Check the [tips and tricks](/handbook/support/workflows/kibana/#tips-and-tricks) to understand what kind of information you can pull using this tool.<br/>[Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/) helps investigate errors across different applications or environments, for example Ruby code related errors. Search on Sentry usually is done using a Correlation ID.<br/>[Grafana](/handbook/engineering/monitoring/#main-monitoring-dashboards) is used for infrastructure metrics collection for GitLab.com |
|Dedicated|The [GitLab Dedicated Logs](/handbook/support/workflows/dedicated_logs/) workflow has information about using Opensearch to view logs. The [Observability and Monitoring](/handbook/support/workflows/dedicated_instance_health/) workflow has information about using Grafana to diagnose performance problems.|

### Configuration
