**Overview**

At GitLab, we take customer success seriously, and our Customer Success Engineer (CSE) team plays a pivotal role in ensuring our global customer base receives unparalleled support and assistance throughout their journey with us.

### **CSE Operating Rhythm**

The [CSE operating rhythm](/handbook/customer-success/csm/segment/cse/cse-operating-rhythm/) outlines procedures CSEs use to engage with customers as well as how account owners can request CSE engagement outside of the normal operating rhythm during the customer lifecycle.

[For the ARR thresholds for the CSE customer segment please reference this Wiki page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/csm/-/wikis/CSM-Segments) (GitLab Internal).

The [DCI matrix](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci) provided below is designed to serve as a guiding framework to improve collaboration across teams. Please note that this is applicable only to accounts interacting with a CSE. For accounts managed by a CSM or CSA, refer to the [CSMA's DCI](/handbook/customer-success/account-team/#customer-success-manager-csm/) on Rules of Engagement.

_The DCI matrix is an outcome of the work of this [OKR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/6329) and is still under review._
