## What can you expect from a Customer Success Architect?

By staying ahead of potential challenges and proactively addressing your needs, your CSA will ensure that you are always on the path to success.

With your CSA as your champion, you can be confident that your voice is heard and your needs are met.

## How are you assigned a Customer Success Architect (CSA)?
A Customer Success Architect (CSA) is a premium Customer Success service available to customers who have purchased GitLab's Success Plan Services (SPS). SPS is a bundled service offering that combines the expertise of a CSA with an [Assigned Support Engineer (ASE)](/handbook/support/workflows/assigned-support-engineer) and comprehensive Education services, including an instructor-led course and 120 certification vouchers. This holistic approach ensures that you have access to the technical guidance, support, and training resources you need to achieve success with GitLab's products and services.

To be assigned a CSA, you must procure the Success Plan Services through the same sales channels as GitLab's licensing SKUs. Your GitLab sales representative will work with you to understand your specific needs and requirements and help you determine if the Success Plan Services are the right fit for your organization. Once you have purchased the SPS bundle, a dedicated CSA will be assigned to your account, ensuring that you have a consistent, knowledgeable, and experienced point of contact throughout your journey with GitLab. Your CSA will work closely with your Assigned Support Engineer (ASE) and Education services team to provide you with a comprehensive and coordinated support experience, helping you maximize the value of your investment in GitLab's products and services.
