## Tools and Resources


Tools and resources provide infomation to help Solution Architects to conduct POV or workshops, respond to RFx, manage customer facing activities, support on-going product learning.

### Education and Enablement

As a Solutions Architect, it is important to be continuously learning more about our product and related industry topics. The [education and enablement handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/education-enablement/) provides a dashboard of aggregated resources that we encourage you to use to get up to speed.

### Proof of Value (POV) Guidelines

Proof of Value (POV), formerly known as Proof of Concept, is conducted during the Technical Evaluation stage with Solutions Architects by  prospects or existing customers to assess the required capabilities based on a set of criteria and value drivers. A POV is a collaboration between GitLab and the prospective or existing customer for evaluating GitLab. Information on the POV guidelines, POV types and process can be found on the [Proof of Value (POV) Guidelines](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/) page.

### SaaS Trials for Existing Customers

Paid customers must set up a new namespace on SaaS when trialing Ultimate.  There are two primary reasons for this:

1. Some paid features are not available in a trial, so a customer might lose functionality they had been using if a trial license is applied
2. GitLab does not have an appropriate mechanism for applying and reverting a trial license on SaaS without the namespace potentially being reverted to free when the trial expires ([see issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12186))

Both situations put customer production GitLab usage at risk if a trial is applied to the SaaS namespace.

Instead, a customer should create a new namespace and trial there.  We have put together some [rial guidelines](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/trial-guidelines/) in order to make the process as seamless as possible for customers.



### Hands-on Workshops

GitLab Solutions Architects conduct hands-on workshops as interactive events for GitLab prospects and customers to learn the GitLab product and DevSecOps capabilities. Workshops may be executed as marketing events or run independently for specific customers. Detail information is provided on the [Hands-on Workshops](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/workshop/) page.

### RFI/RFP Responses

RFx's such as RFI and RFP are common steps in the public sector yet it may be required by enterprise customers to assess, evaluate and procure the software. Solution architects often participate in the RFP process responding to the technical asks and solutions requirements. Information on responding to the RFx can be found on the [RFI/RFP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/Field-Security-RFP.html) page.

### Stack Overflow for Teams 

[Stack Overflow for Teams](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/gitlab-customer-success/questions) is a knowledge sharing and collaboration tool that helps entire Customer Success organization stay productive, onboard faster, and minimize distractions by unlocking information through collaborative knowledge management.
Everyone in Customer Success organization has access to the Stack Overflow for Teams via Okta and is able to answer questions or provide responses directly via web interface

Additionally, it is possible to interact with Stack Overflow using Slack integration via following commands:

- `/stack ask How do I do X?` to ask a question directly via Slack
- `/stack search [search term]` to search for questions and answers

Slack integration also posts notifications about new questions and answers via `#cs-questions` Slack channel for the entire team to stay up to date and boost participation. Adherent to and in support of GitLab's [efficiency value](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency) team members should first [search for an existing answer](/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/) and post a question only if an answer is not readily available.

Stack Overflow for teams replaces older [Customer Success Knowledge Base](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture/sa-knowledge-base/), which is considered deprecated and will be removed in the Future.

### Product Releases

Solution Architects have to keep up the pace of the GitLab monthly product releases to position feature sets and capabilities for the prospect and customer needs while demonstrating the market leading position.

### Data Seeding (Demo Data)

The [GitLab Data Seeder](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/data_seeder.html) is a tool that Solution Architects can use to showcase to customers "what good data looks like" in GitLab.
The data that is generated is customizable, time-relative, and can be used on-demand to generate data to demonstrate.

The Demo Data can be showcased on any self-managed instance including Docker, GDK, and customer environments.
