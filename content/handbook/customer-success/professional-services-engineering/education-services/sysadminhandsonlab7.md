> Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes

### Task A. Access the Prometheus Service

1. GitLab's Prometheus server can be reached via TCP port 9090. Unfortunately, the training environment currently blocks inbound traffic to that port. As a workaround, you can open an SSH tunnel as follows.

    ```bash
    ssh -L 9090:localhost:9090 -i <SSH_KEY_NAME>.pem ec2-user@<GITLAB_INSTANCE_HOSTNAME>
    ```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9090` in a web browser to view the built-in Prometheus server.

1. To view the available metrics in Prometheus, navigate to `http://localhost:9090/metrics`.

    > To see a more detailed list of each metric, check out the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html).

### Task B. Viewing Prometheus Metrics

> For this example, suppose you wanted to monitor HTTP requests sent into your GitLab instance. To achieve this, we can use some built in GitLab metrics.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9090`. 

1. In the input beside the **magnifying glass** button, type `http_requests_total`.

1. Click the **Execute** button.

1. Click **Table** to view a table of all the results generated by the query.

    > You will likely see a variety of different HTTP requests in the results. Note that you can see the `job`, `instance`, `HTTP method` and `status` of each request.

1. Click **Graph** to view a graph of your data.

    > On the left hand side of the graph, you will see a **-** and **+** button. You can click these buttons to change the scale of the graph. Try adjusting the scale to see how it impacts your data.

### Task C. Alert Configurations

> Prometheus can be used to alert administrators based on specific metrics. GitLab comes with a set of predefined alerts for Prometheus.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9090`.

1. Click **Alerts** in the top menu.

    > Note that there are two sets of alert rules, one named GitLab and one named Node. The GitLab alerts correspond to platform issues such as the a service being down, Postgres being down, or high queueing withing services. A Node alert corresponds to the server GitLab is deployed on. 

1. Note the file that contains the alerting rules. By default, the file is `/var/opt/gitlab/prometheus/rules/gitlab.rules`.

    > As an administrator, you can define custom rules inside this file to use for alerting. This will allow you to monitor your system for any potential issues.

### Task D. Common Performance Metrics

There are a variety of different metrics administrators can use to monitor the performance of their GitLab instances. Let's examine a few common queries you can use to monitor an instance.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9090`.

1. In the input beside the **magnifying glass** button, type the following query:

    ```
    ((node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) or ((node_memory_MemFree_bytes + node_memory_Buffers_bytes + node_memory_Cached_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100
    ```

    > This query will show you the percentage of memory available on your instance.

1. Click **Graph** to view the percentage of memory over time.

1. In the query input, delete your previous query and replace it with the following query:

    ```
    1 - avg without (mode,cpu) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]))
    ```

    > This query will show you the percentage of CPU used on your instance.

1. Click **Graph** to view the percent of CPU used over time.

    > For these metrics and many others, you may want to consider alerting for specific conditions. For example, you could alert for cases where the CPU usage exceeds 50% consistently, as it might indicate an issue.
