## What is HelpLab

HelpLab is a GitLab’s branding of the ServiceNow Platform.

[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) is a SaaS Enterprise Service Management Platform that enables organizations to gain operational efficiencies by centralizing and automating Service Life Cycle Management.

Additionally, this solution supports our continued emphasis on keeping team members' sensitive information secure and confidential. When you reach out for support, you will know that it's being handled with the utmost care to maintain your privacy.

## How do I use HelpLab?

1. Login to your [Okta home page](https://gitlab.okta.com/app/UserHome#).
1. Search for HelpLab in the search bar.
1. Click on the HelpLab button.
   - A new tab should open with your user logged in.

### Create a ticket / request

1. Once you've identified the team you need assistance from, look for the topics or categories related to your question or issue.
   - If you're unsure which topic to select, or if your request doesn't fit into any specific category, consider opening a `General Request` available under each team. This option allows you to provide a brief description of your issue or question without selecting a specific topic.
1. Fill in the required details for your request and attach any necessary documents or screenshots to provide additional context.
1. Review your request to ensure accuracy and completeness.
1. Click on the "Submit" button to send your request to the relevant team for processing.

### Add a team member to your ticket / request

After submitting your request, you have the option to add team members, such as your manager, to the `watch list`. Adding team members to the watch list ensures that they receive notifications and have visibility into the case. This feature is useful if there's anybody who needs to have visibility to the case's progress or if additional stakeholders should be informed about updates or resolutions.
