# <i class="fas fa-tasks" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> What We Do

## IT Portfolio Planning & Prioritization

![it-pmo](/handbook/business-technology/pmo/it-pmo-planning.png)

The IT portfolio planning & prioritization process has 6 steps:

1. Portfolio of Projects
2. Prioritization
3. Resources & Capacity Planning
4. Project Commits
5. T-Shirt Sizing
6. Alignment & OKRs

### IT Portfolio of Projects

The inventory of all committed and planned projects for the quarter in IT Operations and Enterprise Applications. The [IT Portfolio: Quarterly Commits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ojnTFGB2iYJz9kNPYdoLc4PeyDqAN60gu9cQBrKpHJQ/edit?pli=1#gid=1316376797) is available for internal team members to track IT planned initiatives. All projects on the IT Portfolio have a Team & Corporate Stack Ranke to align with the overall [global optimization](/handbook/values/#global-optimization).

### IT Project Prioritization

The [IT Project Prioritization tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnV3nWI0sNdbakHUys78d-lpbpKexFD_1kdO8JoVySY/edit#gid=745075679) is used to log new projects / initiatives with the IT team. The IT PMO team will review it as part of the IT Quarterly Portfolio Planning:

![it-pmo](/handbook/business-technology/pmo/quarterly-planning.png)

### Resources & Capacity Planning

Achieved by:
- Identifying all resource on the team
- Estimating capacity like Keeping the lights on (KTLO), Admin, Management and Projects

### Project Commits

All projects added to the [IT Portfolio: Quarterly Commits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ojnTFGB2iYJz9kNPYdoLc4PeyDqAN60gu9cQBrKpHJQ/edit?pli=1#gid=955721517) have:
- Resources assigned in order of priority
- An appropriated label:
   - **Committed**: Projects that are in-flight / being worked on
   - **Planned**: Projects that will be picked up once the resources from a committed project becomes available
   - **Backlog**: Projects that are in the pipeline but not yet ready to start

### T-Shirt Sizing

Consists in identifying the project's:
- Estimated Level Of Effort (LOE)
- Duration
- Roles & Responsibilities

### Alignment & OKRs

All projects added to the [IT Portfolio: Quarterly Commits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ojnTFGB2iYJz9kNPYdoLc4PeyDqAN60gu9cQBrKpHJQ/edit?pli=1#gid=955721517) are part of the Business Technology [OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/) for:
- Awareness
- Accountability
- Value Generation

## Release Management

The release management plan helps the IT team:
- Set an agreed upon standard
- Operationalize
- Keep consistency & predictability
- Communicate changes regularly and transparently

### Release Calendar

# <i class="fas fa-bullhorn" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How We Work

## Governance and Program Management Methodology

Visit the [Governance and IT Program Management](/handbook/business-technology/pmo/pmo-governance/) page to understand the methodology adopted by the IT PMO team for all GitLab IT programs aimed at achieving the following objectives:
- Ensuring robust results and efficient execution.
- Ensuring proper scoping aligned with our value of iteration.
- Engaging appropriate stakeholders in line with our value of collaboration.
- Maintaining proper documentation for compliance, consistent with our transparency value.

## Project Epics & Issues

When assigned to a project, the IT PMO team is responsible for creating and maintaining the project [Epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/index.html). A single parent Epic is created together with (up to) 5 [child Epics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#multi-level-child-epics), each representing a distinct phase of the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC). [Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) are used as a means to collaborate on ideas, troubleshoot problems, and strategize for their tasks. By using issues, teams can share and discuss proposals internally or involve external collaborators in the process.

To maintain uniformity across all PMO-led projects, the team follows the same [Epic templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/394).
{: .alert .alert-warning}

### System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The System Development Lifecycle outlines a structured set of activities conducted at each project stage.

![it-pmo](/handbook/business-technology/pmo/sdlc.png)

#### Intake

The intake process starts with the completion of a business requirements document. It is the bridge between business stakeholders defining what is to be worked on and the development group that will build it.

#### Define

During Define, the project team articulates the business problem and definition of done. This phase covers uses cases, technology impacted and requirements. The ultimate goal of Define is not to figure out everything but to document the process and what is impacted. Finally, before beginning the design, we request approval sign-off from key stakeholders to ensure business requirements are accurate and all-inclusive.

#### Design

This phase creates the roadmap of how things will work in the future. The project team work with the business to design a future state process and refine the requirements to build it. This phase should iron out all the details and questions from above.

#### Build

In the Build phase, the project team collaborates with other stakeholders to develop solutions that meet the business requirements but also that are scalable and aligned with best-practices.

#### Test

During the test phase, the project team collaborates with other stakeholders to develop test scripts and facilitates the user acceptance testing (UAT) process.

#### Deploy

The project team owns developing a deployment plan and collaborating with other implementation teams to ensure completeness. This involves launch plans, user enablement, and go-live communications.

#### Hypercare

Hypercare is the period that immediately follows the deployment / launch of a new process in Production where an elevated level of support is available to ensure the seamless adoption of a new system.

#### Maintenance

The maintenance phase occurs once the new process is fully operational to ensure it continues to function as it was designed to, and repairs or upgrades are performed as needed.

### Roadmap

In order to track the progress of each program efficiently, all Epics are assigned a Start and End dates, and the [GitLab Roadmap](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/roadmap/index.html) is used as a timeline.

### Issue Boards

The IT teams use [issue boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html) in GitLab to strategically plan, organize, and visualize their work managed through GitLab issues. To understand how IT teams organize and manage their issue boards, visit [each team's respective page](/handbook/business-technology/#-the-team).

### Labels

The IT teams use [labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html) to categorize issues and epics effectively. By maintaining a concise list of labels, teams can efficiently organize and tag their work, enabling dynamic filtering and streamlined management of epics and issues. All labels are created in the `gitlab.com/gitlab-com` top-level group so they can be applied to any projects that we work on.

To better organize and manage their work, the IT teams have different label categories. Click on each category to view the current labels utilized by the IT teams:

- [Priority labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-priority)
- [Team labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-entapps)
- [Status labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-status)
- [Project labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-proj)
- [System labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-system)
- [Service Desk labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-service+desk)
- [Intake labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=it-intake)

## Project Reporting

- The IT PMO team uses the Rolly Bot, a tool created by the IT Integrations team aimed at automating the generation and distribution of weekly status updates. Every Friday, the PMO updates the Rolly section of each project Epic (that they are assigned to) to deliver consistent updates on ongoing projects.
   - A new roll up is created every Monday.
- Asynchronous updates of the program are communicated through the dedicated program Slack channel, using [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/).
- For more extensive programs, the IT PMO team may generate a [Weekly Status Report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FvtL0MHftG33b-6eKO1sVx3vPFKu0DaeVp-GGbLdpcs/edit#slide=id.p1) intended for distribution among the program team and is frequently reviewed during the weekly program status meetings.

## Compliance Documentation

The IT PMO team supports project stakeholders in gathering all the essential information required for SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and compliance purposes throughout the project's lifecycle. We have developed multiple templates following the [guidelines](/handbook/business-technology/pmo/pmo-governance/#clear-documentation-for-compliance) provided by the [IT Compliance team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/it-compliance/). These templates aid in creating comprehensive and well-structured documentation, facilitating the gathering of essential information.

The IT PMO team collaborates with project stakeholders to create these documents and ensures that all necessary approvals are captured within them.

## Enablement Plan

The IT PMO team takes the lead in initiating discussions regarding enablement and collaborates with the project lead to develop training materials and communication plans, as required.

## IT Quarter Planning Process

There are several activities that take place to prepare for new OKRs / commits and report on the current ones:
- **Project List & Priorities from Business**: The IT PMO team reaches out to Business stakeholders to get a list of projects and priorities for the upcoming quarter.
- **Update OKR(s) progress**: The IT PMO works with IT Leadership to update the OKR(s) progress in gitlab.com.

## Weekly Roll Up Reporting

The IT Integrations team designed the Rolly Bot, a tool aimed at automating the generation and distribution of weekly status updates. With this tool, the IT PMO Team can deliver consistent updates on ongoing projects. A new roll-up is produced every Monday.

## Definitions and terms used across the IT department

- **Service Desk**: Single point of contact between IT service providers and users/customers. The primary goal of the Service Desk is to ensure that all incidents, service requests, and other IT-related issues are promptly addressed and resolved, ensuring minimal disruption to the business.
- **Continual Service Improvement (CSI)**: An ongoing process that focuses on improving the quality of services and the efficiency of IT processes. It involves identifying areas for improvement, implementing changes, and measuring the results.
- **Service Request, Change request and Incident**: three distinct concepts that play essential roles in IT Service Management. Here are the key differences between them:

| Concept | Definition | Purpose | Examples |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Service Request** | A service request is a formal request from a user or customer for information, advice, a standard change, or access to an IT service. It involves predefined and well-documented procedures. | Service requests are typically routine, low-risk, and straightforward tasks that do not require major changes to the IT environment. They aim to fulfill specific user needs and provide predefined services quickly and efficiently. | Password reset, user account creation, software installation, email account setup, hardware procurement, conference room booking, etc. |
| **Change Request** | A change request is a formal proposal to modify the configuration of an IT service, system, or infrastructure in a controlled manner. It aims to introduce improvements, fix issues, implement new features, or make any other alterations that can potentially impact the existing environment. | Change requests involve making intentional changes to the IT environment, and they need to be carefully evaluated, planned, and implemented to avoid disruptions and minimize risks. Change management ensures that changes are controlled and align with business objectives. | Software upgrade, hardware replacement, infrastructure configuration change, service maintenance window, database schema modification, etc. |
| **Incident** | An incident is an unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. It can also refer to the failure of a configuration item (CI) that has not yet impacted service but poses a significant risk of doing so in the future. | Incidents are unexpected events that disrupt normal service operations and require immediate attention to restore service to its normal state. Incident management focuses on minimizing the impact of incidents on users and business operations. | Network outage, application crash, server failure, data loss, email delivery problems, etc. |


- **Project:** To be considered a project the request need to meet all the below criteria:
   - The work will taken more than 48hrs to be built and tested (end to end)
   - Involves 2 or more systems
   - Involves 2 or more stakeholders
   - Involves 2 or more teams (even within IT so for example, EntApps LTC and EntApps Integrations)

The main difference between a project and a change request in ITIL lies in their scope, nature, and the processes they follow. Projects are temporary, comprehensive efforts aimed at achieving specific goals, while change requests are smaller, routine or ad-hoc requests to modify existing IT services or configurations.
