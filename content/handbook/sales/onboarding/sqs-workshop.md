## Sales Quick Start Workshop

- NOTE: The Sales Quick Start (SQS) Workshop is MANDATORY for all new Sales Team Members. If you must cancel for any reason, please be sure to obtain Regional Director approval in writing.
- After completing the virtual, self-paced Sales Quick Start learning path, new sales team members (along with new Solution Architects, Customer Success Managers, and Sales Development Rep) participate in an interactive in-person workshop where participants practice applying this new knowledge in fun and challenging ways including mock calls, role plays, and group activities
  - As a result, new sales team members exit Sales Quick Start more confident and capable in their ability to lead an effective discovery call with a customer or prospect
  - Participants also benefit by establishing a community of similarly-tenured peers and more experienced mentors and colleagues to support each others' growth and development at GitLab
- **Note: The Results Value is our highest priority and we strive to deliver sales training and enablement remotely as much as possible and reserve in-person formats only for circumstances when we can't obtain the desired results via remote/virtual delivery)**
  - Iteration is expected to keep moving what we can to remote models once we can achieve the same or better results that way
- Future iteration of this process will define what sales team members need to **KNOW**, **DO**, and **BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE** (by sales role, customer segment, and geo as appropriate) after they complete the above and support those learning objectives as they continue their ramp to GitLab sales performance excellence!
