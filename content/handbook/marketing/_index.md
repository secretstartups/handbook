<i class="fas fa-bullhorn fa-fw color-orange font-awesome"></i> Welcome to the GitLab Marketing Handbook
{.h2}

The GitLab Marketing team operates as one team and is organized by the following departments: [Integrated Marketing](/handbook/marketing/#integrated-marketing), [Brand and Product Marketing](/handbook/marketing/#brand-and-product-marketing), [Marketing Operations and Analytics](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-strategy-and-platforms), [Sales Development](/handbook/marketing/#sales-development), [Growth](/handbook/marketing/growth/), [Corporate Communications](/handbook/marketing/#corporate-communications), and [Developer Relations & Community](/handbook/marketing/#developer-relations--community). This page documents our shared team philosophy and processes, while the individual department handbooks contain more detailed information.

## Marketing Purpose

GitLab is the leading DevSecOps Platform that empowers organizations to deliver quality software faster and more efficiently while strengthening security and compliance. The marketing team’s purpose is to amplify the value of the GitLab platform, authentically and transparently, by putting customers and the community at the center of everything we do.

## Marketing Alignment

As the GitLab Marketing team puts customers at the center of everything we do, the marketing strategy aligns with the customer journey. The journey’s purpose is to provide a clear and cohesive experience to a prospect/customer from the minute they become **Aware** of GitLab, to **Considering** the platform and **Converting** into a happy customer, and then of course **Expanding** over time and becoming an **Evangelist**.

![marketing customer journey](mktgcustomerjourney.png)

Each stage has a purpose which is the guiding indicator for the marketing team to measure our success. Everything the team plans and executes in the short and long term will revolve around the customer journey, and we will also measure our success along each step to hold ourselves accountable.

![marketing customer journey stages](mktgcustomerjourneystages1.png)

## Marketing Strategy

Our FY24 Marketing Strategy and Plan can be found in [the internal handbook](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/fy24-strategy/).

## Marketing OKRs

Each quarter, the Marketing team creates OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) that cascade from the [CEO's OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/#most-recent-okrs).

Each department within the Marketing team manages their own cascading OKRs.

## <i class="fas fa-users fa-fw color-orange font-awesome"></i> How we work

Value-driven Marketing Team
{.h3}

How we work as one team aligns with the [GitLab Values](/handbook/values/).

**Results** - The team measures success together along the customer journey. Each quarter, we align CMO OKRs based on company goals set in the CEO OKRs. This helps us stay aligned with company-level goals while also understanding if what we are doing quarter over quarter is moving the needle on our marquee metrics along the customer journey. Being data-driven as a team is essential for team success.

**Iteration** - Like the rest of the company, we aspire to be agile and experimental where possible.  In every area possible, we roll out campaigns, brand updates, messaging, etc. in small iterations, measure the success, and take next steps accordingly.

**Transparency** - We strive to be as transparent as possible in all areas of marketing. We welcome thoughts and feedback from each other, other GitLab team members, and the community at all times.

**Collaboration** - A major key to success is operating as one team. Leveraging the different backgrounds, cultures and, skill sets of an entire company and community, the marketing team operates in a way where everyone can contribute. Collaboration is key to taking Marketing to the next level.

**Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB)** - With GitLab team members being located across the world, we strive to always keep DIB at the core of everything we do. Like the rest of GitLab, we follow asynchronous meeting principles, welcome diverse perspectives, and as marketers, foster an environment where quirkiness is welcomed.

**Efficiency** - We keep efficiency at the forefront of everything we do. Whether it is bringing in marketing technology to automate menial tasks and foster collaboration, finding ways to save cost, or simply doing the right things to be respectful of others’ time, efficiency drives faster results for marketing.

## Team Meeting Cadence

All team members are encouraged to bring forward discussion topics that they want to share with the team or to have covered during the call.

Quarterly CMO Q&A (one session for each department)
{.h3}

{.h3}

**Goal**: Foster an environment to empower managers overseeing different functions to collaborate and share ideas and feedback.

### Sponsorship

We are happy to sponsor events and meet-ups where a marketing benefit exists, subject to approval by Field Marketing Managers. These sponsorships may be in cash or in kind, depending on individual circumstances.

Organizational or project sponsorships may also be considered where a marketing benefit exists. Typically, these sponsorships will be in kind - e.g., developer time commitments, or [subsidized / free GitLab licenses](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/06/05/gitlab-ultimate-and-gold-free-for-education-and-open-source/).

Cash sponsorship of projects or organizations may be considered only in exceptional cases - for example, if a project or organization that GitLab depends on is struggling to survive financially.

Marketing Functional Conversations are modeled after Group conversations.

The goal of Marketing Functional Conversations is to create increased awareness and mutual understanding of the functions within Marketing. Awareness and understanding is an essential building block for effective collaboration.

### Sales Development

The [Sales Development](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/) organization is focused on serving the needs of prospective customers during the beginning of their buying process.

The Sales Development department is composed of 2 groups: the SDR team who handles all the inbound interest and the BDR team who specializes in outreach of prospective customers.

When prospective customers have questions about GitLab, the SDRs assist them or connect them to a technical team member as needed. During the initial exploration, if the prospective customer is interested in continuing their exploration of GitLab, SDRs will connect them to an Account Executive (AE) or Strategic Account Executive (SAE).

BDRs contact people who work at large organizations to uncover or create early-stage sales opportunities for GitLab SAEs. The BDR team will plan with their paired Sales counterpart to approach interesting accounts and develop a plan for prospecting including contact discovery, understanding enterprise-wide initiatives that GitLab could assist with, and ensuring accurate data quality of accounts and contact in salesforce.com.
