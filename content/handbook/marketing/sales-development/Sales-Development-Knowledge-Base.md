## Sales Development Knowledge Base

This page is part of the Sales Development team's handbook [page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/) and aims to be the in-depth knowledge base of our org. The content below is sourced from the input of many past team members and is here for you to perfect your inbound and outbound sales development skills. 

Please review at your own leasure, and we're excited to receive your contributions as well!

## Best Practices for Outbound BDRs

### Cold-Calling and Email Checklist

Our cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.

To be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:

- Different Geographical Business Cultures
- Personality Type as per the DISC model
- Individual’s Role and Responsibilities
- Business’ Needs and Objectives

### Call Scripts

You can find three examples of our cold call scripts in the description of the [BDR 101 Level Up Course](https://university.gitlab.com/learn/course/bdr101-outbound-cold-calling/bdr101-outbound-calls/f50b8a1c-712b-44e7-a30f-2ddbbc835ccf?client=internal-team-members&page=5)

The main documentation may be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3iV_WW5fRidRN5H8-3SZVAAr3ffEvjxUC6cW5SFXDM/edit) and the library of resources [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhxVwy4DoEvFco_wXeOLb0DLtVIfo7wQ).

### Up-Front Contract

Typically used for scheduled calls and Up-Front Contracts. UFCs can also be used as a defense mechanism when cold calling does not go as planned. For cold-calling, UFCs are used when the prospect can commit to 15’ at the time of the call. If they commit to a 15’ for a later time, UFCs are used to open the call and set the agenda then.

Explore the main documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7qEq8g3eHh5-oagERGvNmatiOV3JXi9Tw46SKWwpNM/edit).

### Decision Maker Discovery

The questions below are suggestions to be used while doing a discovery call, in order to identify the decision making process, and to meet the outbound accepted SAO as per the guidelines [here.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#criteria-for-outbound-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao)

- Who gets involved while evaluating a tool at {{company}}?
- Would you expect anyone to challenge your initiative, and if so can I help by connecting with anyonse else on your end?
- If you as a {{title}} wanted to purchase GitLab, what process internally would you have to follow, and how can we help you navigate it?
- What challenges do you expect to face when trying to pitch this change internally? Who has a say in this and what do they care about the most?

### Email Writing Cheat Sheet

The table below shows the Command of the Message Email Writing Checklist.

It aims to outline the structure of the emails we write to prospects. Emails should be written in each person’s language and tone and make sure to include the CoM frameworks as per the outline below. You can find additional resources [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DF6bEtS9QF9idqBcK77RiLL04CKiFMuc0LDEM5N6RA/edit)

## New Outreach Sequence/Workflow creation.

In an effort to better iterate, and refresh, our outreach content and workflows, we have a structured process for BDRs to create/measure new Outreach sequences.

Please log an issue [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/new) by selecting the template `BDR_Sequence_Creation_Request.`

The issue description will walk you through all the next steps.

This process aims to:

**Implement Measurement Clarity and Decision Velocity**

By dogfooding GitLab we have a structured and simplified cadence of quantifying sequence creation in terms of value and results without limiting agency.

**Maintain Equal Contributions in a Shared Reality**
By maintaing a Single Source of Truth (SSoT) we give the best possible forum for cross-functional collaboration with specific guidelines

### Outreach Sequence Creation Process

#### Building a New Sequence, Prior to Setting it Live
As you begin building your new sequence, make sure you are following the proper guidelines:

* **Naming Convention** - all sequences should use the approved naming convention:
    -   **Year** (FY24)
    -   **Team** (IB)
    -   **Region** (Worldwide - WW, AMER, APAC, EMEA, LATAM)
    -   **Segment** (SMB SDR, LARGE MM SDR)
    -   **Target/Reason for Sequence** (Trial, Contact Request, Event, etc)
    -   **Touch Level** (High Touch - HT, Low Touch - LT)
    -   **Language** (English - EN, Spanish - SP, Portuguese - POR, French - FR, German - GER, Dutch - DUT, Russian - RUS, Korean - KOR, Japanese - JP)

**Example** - FY24 IB WW SMB SDR Free to Paid HT EN

* **Sequence Settings**:
    - **Sequence Type** - Steps by day interval
	- **Delivery Schedule** - Weekday Business Hours
	- **Interval Type** - Schedule Days
	- **Tags** - always add “SDR” or "BDR" and “Inbound” or "Outbound" along with any other applicable tags such as the Region, Team, and Touch Level
	- **Collections** - choose the appropriate collection based on team and purpose
	- **Shared with Org?** - Others can see it and use it
	- **When the primary prospect replies** - Finish sequence
	- **When non-primary prospects reply** - Finish sequence
	- **Prospect Throttling** - Enabled
	- **Max active prospects per user** - 1000
	- **Auto-activate prospects** - Yes - activate based on throttles
	- **Max adds per user every 24 hours** - 100
	- **Sequence Ruleset**:
        - **Default** - Does not make tasks on your behalf. Prospects can be added to these sequences more than once, if not already active. prospects are not able to be added to other exclusive sequences, but can be added to a non-exclusive sequence. Updates prospects to appropriate stages. Resumes out of office prospects after 5 days.
        - **Campaign** - Follows the same rules as the default settings except out of office are resumed 1 day after.
        - **Create Call Task** - Follows same rules as the default except it will create call tasks on opened emails. Minimum email opens needed: 2
        - **Event** - Prospects can only be added to this sequence once. They are not exclusive to this sequence. Out of office are resumed 1 day after.
        - **Follow Up Sequences** - This ruleset is specifically designed for prospects who are already in qualifying stage as once you add them, their lead status will stay in qualifying rather than going back to accepted.
        - **Saas Trial** - for following up with trial leads

* **Email Settings**:
    - **Click Tracking** on all emails
    - **Open Tracking** on all emails
    - Appropriate variable template syntax

* **Email Messaging**:
    - For each email step in your sequence, send yourself a test email to ensure formatting is appropriate and all variables are set correctly.

Once you have set your sequence up with the proper name, structure, settings and email messaging, return to the issue and tag your manager and sales development operations manager for approval. **If your sequence is rejected, you will need to make the necessary changes to gain approval. If your sequence is approved, you are cleared to move forward with setting your sequence live. A decision on approval will be made within 48 hours of the request.**

#### Setting a Sequence Live
Go into the sequence settings and toggle the bar in the upper left from gray (paused) to green (active). You are now ready to use your sequence.

#### _For Managers_

#### Approving the Build of a New Sequence
* When deciding whether to approve or deny the creation of a new sequence, use your best judgment to decide whether this sequence really needs to be built, or if what the rep is looking for can be accomplished with an A/B test or by utilizing one of the existing ops-approved sequences. Is the sequence/step that is being replaced actually underperforming?
* If creation of the new sequence meets with your approval, go to the issue and add your approval. If you don’t approve, leave a comment explaining why the sequence has been denied.

#### Approving the Activation of a New Sequence
When deciding whether to approve or deny the activation of a new sequence, make sure the sequence follows all proper guidelines, including:
* Naming Convention
* Structure
* Sequence Settings
* Email Settings
    - Click/Open Tracking
    - Variable template syntax
* Sequence messaging is appropriate and acceptable

If all of these conditions are met, go back to the issue and add your approval. If the rep needs to revise anything before they can set it live, leave a comment explaining what they still need to do before they can begin using their sequence.

Managers then need to add a tag of “manager approved” on the sequence in Outreach


#### Post Sequence Live
30 day check - is the sequence meeting performance benchmarks?


## Making Changes to the handbook

[Video Walkthrough of how to make changes to the GitLab Handbook for the Sales Development org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Nv7bzksiY&t=1032s)

One of our Values is being handbook first. 

In order to align the SDR organization more closely to this ideal, below are suggested steps. Please remember that the Handbook is a living document, and you are strongly encouraged to make improvements and add changes. This is ESPECIALLY true when it comes to net new solutions that should be shared so the whole organization has access to that process. (aka The DevOps ideal of turning “Localized Discoveries” into “Global Knowledge”.)

Steps:

- Have a change you want to make to the handbook? Great!
- Navigate to the source code of the page in the handbook (e.g. Link to edit the SDR page in the Handbook )
- Click either “Edit” or “Web IDE” to make your changes.
- Have a brief but descriptive “Commit message” (e.g. “Add new section on ‘How to Make Changes to the Handbook’”) and commit your changes
- Fill out the Merge Request details

## Follow Up Outreach Sequences

- For SDRS and BDRS that want to sequence leads in their qualifying views we created [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKE24LRJbcc) to help you create a workflow around this follow up [sequence.](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/9383)

- The same video also showcases the [Auto Follow Up](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/9543) to Book a Meeting Sequence SDRs and BDRs can use when a prospect responds to one of their sequences.

## Automatic Enrollment to Sequences

From FY24Q4 onwards, we will pilot [automatic triggers](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/221361788-How-To-Create-an-Outreach-Trigger) through Outreach. As a first iteration, we will be automatically enrolling leads that indicate a high Propensity to Purchase (PTP) score to a full High Touch outreach sequence. The filters applicable for this trigger are:

- Lead has direct phone in their record
- Lead has a high PTP score (4 or 5)
- Lead is actively enrolled to a Low Touch Sequence

## BDR Territory Movement Rules of Engagement

When a territory moves from one BDR to another but the previous BDR remains with the same team (ex: moves from one MM territory to another) the BDR vacating the territory will have the chance to temporarily retain ownership of accounts with which they have generated ongoing engagement (subject to manager approval). At the time of the holdover, an issue will be created that will be reviewed in 30 days to verify account ownership. This includes:

- The outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which they can demonstrate two-way engagement that could potentially lead to an IQM and new opportunity. If, after 30 days, no IQM has been set and no stage 0 opportunity exists, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory. If the outgoing BDR is successful in generating a new opportunity, the account will remain with them until the opportunity is either qualified or unqualified.
- The outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which there is an existing stage 0 opportunity where they are listed as the BDR. After 30 days if the opportunity is not qualified, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory.
- In instances where an account has been reassigned to the new BDR and the outgoing BDR had two-way engagement more than 30 days ago with the account but was unable to convert them to an SAO, and the account later returns unprompted and with no prior activity from the new BDR assigned to the territory and wants to pursue a conversation with sales, the team (manager) will receive SAO credit from any resulting opportunity.
- Any other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the BDRs’ leader and senior leader.

## Working with Resellers

The end-user account determines the BDR/SDR alignment: If you are the SDR assigned to the 3rd party lead, please gather the information in point 1 and pass the lead to the correctly assigned BDR (the BDR assigned to the end-user account) who will complete points 2-6

| Step                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gather billing and end-user details from the reseller | - Billing company name/address: <br> - Billing company contact/email address: <br> - End-user company name/address: <br> - End-user contact/email address: <br> - Snippet in outreach |
| Create a new lead record with end-user details | - Ensure that all notes are copied over to the new LEAD as this is the LEAD that will be converted.                                                                     |
| Converting the new lead                        | - Name opp to reflect reseller involvement as shown here: “End-user account name via reseller account name” <br> - Convert original reseller lead to a contact associated with the reseller account <br> - If an account does not already exist for the reseller, create one when converting the lead to a contact <br> - Assign the record to the same account owner <br> - Do NOT create a new opportunity with this lead. |
| Attach activity to the opportunity            | - On the reseller contact, go to the activity and link each activity related to your opportunity to the opp. <br> - Activity History > click edit to the left of the activity > choose ‘opportunity’ from the ‘related to’ dropdown > find the new opportunity > save |
| Update the opportunity                         | - Change the business type to new business and stage to pending acceptance. <br> - Under contacts, add the reseller contact, role as reseller, and primary contact. <br> - Under partners, add the reseller account as VAR/Reseller |

## SDR/BDR to AE SAO Handoff Process

The purpose of the BDR-AE outbound handoff process is three fold.

- Ensure Outbound prospects get the best experience possible.
- Ensure the BDR team enjoys operational efficiencies and have clearly structured ways to collaborate with the AE team on outbound accounts.
- Ensure the AE team is set up for success is receiving outbound leads in a structured manner and have the appropriate information to utilize in converting them.

To make sure that the hand-offs maximize internal efficiencies, it is required that:

- The BDR team makes sure to book calls, with a minimum notice time of 48 business hours.
- The BDR team makes sure to properly fulfil Outbound SAO criteria, or work with AE to create a mutual command plan.
- The AE team makes sure to:
    - Accept SAOs within 8 working hours after an IQM call.
    - To leave a chatter note on the opportunity record, tagging BDR and AE manager with feedback on the level of qualification and handoff in case of discrepancies.
    - To be responsible for managing the prospect relationship after all handoff types have taken place. This includes re-scheduling conflicts.

### 1. BDR Qualified Meeting

- Are leads that have been qualified by the BDR over a Discovery call.
- CoM principles have been applied to the call and some of the Before/After Scenarios, Positive Business Outcomes, Requirements and Metrics have been identified and agreed upon between the prospect and the BDR.
- There is a clear need or intent identified from the side of the company, and the prospect has clearly articulated a path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.


**BDR steps after discovery call**

- Summarize CoM principles uncovered during the call
- Schedule next step through Outreach while being on the call with the prospect
    - Meeting Type should be 45’ Evaluation Orchestration Call and body of invitation should be adjusted to meet the prospect’s needs.
- Send AE Intro Email
    - For demanding hand-offs, customer-facing agenda may also be copied and attached to intro email.
- Log Required SFDC fields and populate Notes field.
- Unless there’s a scheduling conflict for the BDR, attend Evaluation Orchestration Call and kick-off the call:
    - Summarize the BDR qualifying conversation by mentioning and verifying the before and after scenario of the prospect, as transcribed on the SAO notes.
    - After prospect acknowledges that their internal situation have not changes inbetween BDR and AE call, recap the expectations and metrics as transcribed on the SAO notes and handoff to AE to move forward.

#### 2. Joint IQM

- Are meetings booked with leads that are from pre-agreed upon Actively Working Acounts.
- Calls scheduled for these prospects will be taken as a joint IQM with both BDR and AE attending, and leading the qualification.
- CoM principles will be applied during the call, with the goal of uncovering a clear need and path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.

**BDR steps before discovery call**

- Schedule next step through Outreach while being on the call with the prospect, and schedule straight to the AEs calendar.
    - Meeting Type should be 15’ Discovery Call.
- Create SFDC opportunity, and log any pre-determined or relevant information from your past reseearch.
- Communicate with AE, and create a mutual command plan for the call.
    - When kicking off the call, summarize the BDR research and reason for reaching out, such compelling events, Persons with LIM, etc
    - After prospect acknowledges their compelling event and internal situation, discovery call continues with pre agreed upon structure with AE.

## Organizing a Group Demo 

Organizing a shared demo makes it more simple for us to offer spontaneously a demonstration of GitLab, which should result in a easier handover of opps, and ease to create opps. As BDRs, we arranged the execution of this demo by creating a zoom webinar, and configuring the whole event so that the administrative side is automated.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Define the criteria that qualifies an opportunity as eligible to go to a shared demo.**                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| SAL/AE is involved only                                                    | The SAL can invite his/her/their customers or contacts in order to add value to their ongoing discussion, if the AE/SAL finds it relevant. This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer.                                                                                              |
| SAL/AE and BDR are involved                                                | The BDR schedules a discovery meeting with the SAL (whether it is a prospect or customer) that generates a qualified opportunity. Once the opportunity is created, the SAL/BDR suggests the shared demo instead of the individual demo based on the priority of the opportunity (importance of the account, number of licenses, amount of the opportunity, persona). This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer. There needs to be an opportunity in this case to suggest the demo, for the sake of collaboration between the SAL and the BDR. |
| BDR is involved only                                                       | When a lead with decision power or significant influence in the org (no individual contributor) expresses a high interest for GitLab (aka: high read/open rates on an email, response received by phone with interest confirmed) AND when the BDR has a tangible reason to think that there is a need in the division/team/company (research, information obtained through other leads in the same org), the BDR can leverage the shared demo for HOT leads to create interest or a sense of urgency, the goal being to have the lead jump on an introductory meeting after the shared demo. |

## White Glove Event Follow Up Sequence (SAEs Included)

For more personal events, such as Executive Roundtables, there many be more detailed Last Event Notes that have an ask to include the people who interacted with the prospect at the event. For these situations we have a [specialized white glove sequence.](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/12883)

 The goal of this sequence is to reach out to the prospect quickly and to include our SAEs/AEs in the conversation.

- The first step is to put the prospect in the Sequence. From there customize the first email step to include the people mentioned in the Last Event Notes. You can also delay the time that the first email goes out so you have more time to get feedback from the SAE/AE if needed.
- Next send a screenshot of the first email step to the SAE/AE’s that will be CC’d. Explain to them that this strategy creates space for them to engage with more specific messaging if the prospect is unresponsive. NOTE: There is a generic task on Day 12 to reach out to the SAE/SA if there has not been any engagement. The goal is to keep them in the loop and for you to work together to engage the prospect.

## Growth Strategies, Ranking and RoE 


**Strategies:** 

- Growth within an existing customer account: BDR should strategically partner with SAE/ISR to identify additional business units to bring into the conversation as growth opportunities. Renewal dates should be exploited.
- Expansion into parent/children/subsidiaries of existing customer accounts: These are accounts that fall within the corporate hierarchy within Salesforce. If a child/subsidiary account is identified via ZoomInfo but not in our system, then BDR should follow the following process: Create a LEAD for that account and then convert to CONTACT to create the ACCOUNT when you qualify your first lead.
- Free to paid upgrades: Existing Core/CE users can be targeted to upgrade to a paid version of GitLab

**Ranking and prioritization of accounts:**

- Rank 1: Expand with Purpose (EwP) accounts should be closely/strategically worked with SAEs. These accounts have High 6Sense intent scores and should therefore be High touch by BDR.
- Rank 2: ICP Ultimate parent accounts that have Core/CE-Users in a hierarchy, Total CARR/LAM for account, Med/Low 6Sense intent scores, and small renewals in current FQ.
- Rank 3: As above but are not our ICP

**Professional Services Opportunities**

A Professional Services Opportunity will be used to cover any integration, consulting, training or other service that a Sales rep will sell to a prospect/client and needs or wants to be invoiced separately. To invoice separately a new quote and opportunity must be created.

## Monthly Audit Process

In an effort to increase transparency as well as consistency in terms of credit attribution for opportunities sourced by the Sales Development organization, we will conduct on a monthly basis a full audit of all opportunities giving credit to either a Sales Development or a Business Development Representative. Please do note that SDRs/BDRs that are on their ramping quarter are exempt from being auditors.

Participating and completing the audit on time is mandatory.

Guiding principles: 

1. All activities must be logged and documented in Salesforce. <br>
2. Timestamps for such activities will be audited and cannot be modified after the fact
Sourcing cases must be clearly documented. <br>
3. All opportunities associated with a Sales Development team member must have meaningful engagement for Web Directs and full qualifications criteria for Direct Deals.

**Mandatory SLA:** Audit and XDR response must be completed by the first day of the following month. Rulings will be completed by the management team by the end of the second day.  Invitations and pairing will be sent to the entire Sales Dev team the first week of the month. It is the responsibility of the team member to find a backfill to do their audit if they are unable to complete the audit within set timelines.

### XDR'S RESPONSIBILITY:

1. All activities must be logged in Salesforce. 
Pro-actively flag opportunities with questions or created outside the standard process in the monthly [Audit Doc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBSfKuK6QcvsAIPvW7uYYCjeMtqPmpeDv2swsPAZShc/edit#gid=0). Please note that there's a separate audit worksheet specific to the PubSec team that is shared separately for compliance reasons.

Examples: web directs. AE-created. Partner generated (for now), Opp w/no value, duplicate opp

### AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY:

1. Auditor needs to review all notes and time stamps related to the opportunity
2. Auditor needs to log an activity #Audited on the activity record of the opportunity as mentioned below, this way we can track completion of monthly audit.
3. Ensure that relevant activity & products are attached.
4. Ensure that Products match up to Qualification info in Call Connect and/or Meeting
5. For BDRs, ensure account was in AWA status
ensuring that the [RoE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-quick-guide) was followed
6. Flag in the monthly [Audit Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBSfKuK6QcvsAIPvW7uYYCjeMtqPmpeDv2swsPAZShc/edit#gid=0), any questions related to the audited opportunities.

### AUDIT PROCESS:

Each month you will be assigned one of your peers to Audit. We will share a report with all the S1 opportunities created that month. SDRs will audit SDRs and BDRs will audit BDRs. We will do our best to pair people from the same segment however it is possible that you end up auditing someone from another segment. 

Once you’ve audited an opp, you will create a task by logging a call, choose “other” as type, and write “#Audited” in the subject line. If an opp needs more research, write “#Audited - Pending Review” and add this opp into the Audit Review spreadsheet.

### AUDIT REVIEW (what to look for): 

| Action | Rationale | Coaching Opportunity | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Opp creator    |    Our standard is to get to credited for creating opportunities that meet the qualification criteria.    |   When you set up a conversation with an AE, you should create the opportunity. If we see that an opp was created by an AE but has the SQS = Sales Dev Generated, there will need to be evidence of meaningful engagement by the Sales Dev rep prior to the opp being created.   |
| For Web Direct opportunities, check timestamp and for two way meaningful engagement prior to the purchase       | Web Direct opportunities are people that bought directly from the store themselves without necessarily having being influenced by us.       |  Explain that our role in this company is to directly influence purchasing decisions through positive and purposeful interactions with prospects. Requesting credit when we have not added specific value to a prospect's journey diminishes the credibility of our team. | 
| Check to see whether opportunity qualification fields are populated. | Marketing and Sales are expected to collaborate to move prospects down the funnel based on specific qualifiers. When it comes to Stage-0 opportunities these are the opportunity qualification fields. | It's common that individuals do not fill these fields in the name of agility. This however does not create accountability in progressing these prospects down the funnel in a predictable manner. |
| Check the date of opportunity creation. | Creation of the opportunity should occur when you're engaged with the prospect and have begun the qualification process. There will sometimes be a child or related opp that needs to  be created based on needs discovered during the IQM with AE. Should that be the case, the created child/related opp should have the IQM activity as a related task on it. | Explain that creating opps as soon as engagement occurs will lead to better management of a BDRs/SDRs pipeline. | 
| Check to see if there is a contact associated to the opp and that there's meaningful engagement prior to the opp being created. | Our standard process requires that we work specific leads and that we convert the main contact person to a contact/opportunity upon qualification. | Explain that this best practice will help with measuring and moving an opportunity further down the pipeline because of accurately being able to communicate the decision-making team from the prospect's side. |
| If activity shows up on the record, and the activity is a connected call with notes, verify that the activity matches in Outreach. | Activities on SFDC can be edited freely and therefore questioned by our audit team. | Explain that Outreach is a SSoT that can be used as irrefutable proof of outreach. Even if other systems fail, Outreach is always used as the last back-up. |
| If activity matches, check that activity happened in accordance with our Actively Working Rules Of Engagement (RoE). | Team members from both Sales and Marketing are expected to contribute pipeline only within their assigned territory. | Explain that making sure that being aligned to the RoE will not create any contigencies when measuring pipeline. |

#### Typical Red Flags:

1. Opportunity Source: Sales Qualified Source should be SDR generated if not validate that there is a sourcing case documented. 
2. Created by: The XDR should create the opportunity, if not, there should be a written explanation 
3. Did the XDR set and complete a meeting on the same day without previous activity?
4. Are there duplicate opportunities?
5. Is NetARR missing?

_Directors, Ops and JB will select random opps each month to audit and ensure audit process is being followed_

#### Best practices to ensure credit for SAO:

1. Sequence all leads if you’re reaching out
2. Make sure your activity is logged that shows how you drove the meaningful engagement that led to the opportunity.
3. Populate all qualification fields
4. If activity was a phone call or a zoom call, log notes at the time of call
5. If a meeting was set, make sure you create a stage 0 opportunity prior to the meeting, populate fields during/afterwards. If person will likely web direct, keep opp in your name and update next steps
6. If engagement is in LinkedIn or Whatsapp, take a picture and attach to chatter/opp
7. If activity happened at an event, make sure that immediately following the event, you create a stage 0 opportunity and  send follow up email that recaps the conversation that took place
