# Brand Resources


## Overview

Welcome to the Brand Resources page. This is your one-stop shop for the most updated brand-related assets, including logos, slide templates, social media graphics, and more.

We are all stewards of the GitLab brand. Our brand is the embodiment of our [mission](/handbook/company/mission/#mission), [vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision), and [values](/handbook/values/). The Brand team works to enable the entire organization with resources you'll need to best represent the GitLab brand as we continue to build awareness.

If you have questions or you're looking for something not listed on this page, please reach out in the #brand channel on Slack.

## Brand guidelines
