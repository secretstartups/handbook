# The GitLab Brand Strategy team

The Brand Strategy team is responsible for accelerating GitLab’s path to market by creating awareness, trust, and affinity for the GitLab brand.

## Meet the team:

- Rebecca Clayman: Director of Brand Strategy - `@rclayman`
- Matthew Jordan: Senior Brand Manager - `@jmatthewj`
- Betsy Bula: Senior Brand Manager - `@bbula`

We’re part of the broader [Brand and Product Marketing team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/) at GitLab, and we’re close counterparts of the Brand Creative team. Looking for design-related resources? Check out the [Brand Creative handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/).

# What we do

Our team's work falls into four pillars:

- **Brand research:** Measuring the health of our brand—including awareness, consideration, competitive positioning, and more—with surveys and research studies.
- **Brand messaging**: Umbrella-level messaging that defines our brand and positions GitLab as an industry leader.
- **Brand marketing:** Building awareness via always-on marketing campaigns.
- **Brand governance:** Empowering internal and external advocates to become brand champions.

In FY24, our goal is to establish a global, always-on digital presence with breakthrough awareness-building and thought leadership campaigns that position GitLab as the leading DevSecOps platform.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

If you receive a vendor request for GitLab to act as a reference (case study, blog post or GitLab logo on their website, etc.) for the product, service, or technology that your GitLab team is using, please refer to these guidelines and check to see if the request meets the criteria. If it does, you can move through the approval process to notify the Brand team of your request.
