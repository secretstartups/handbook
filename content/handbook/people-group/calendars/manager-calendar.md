title: Programs Calendar - People Managers
description: >-
  The Talent Programs Calendar helps people managers priortise and plan ahead. It is the one overview that shows all Talent Programs that require people manager input and execution.
---

This page shows an overview of the Talent Programs that People Managers are involved in. The goal of this page is to ensure that People Managers can plan ahead and have an overview of upcoming programs and timelines.

Each program has its own page with exact dates as SSOT and content that is linked in the calendar `Actions` section below. Exact People program dates may shift slightly as we get closer to the execution of the programs listed, so we recommend you reference the SSOT links for the most accurate timelines and updates. All programs which require people manager action will be announced in Slack in the #managers or #people-managers-and-above channels at the time of launch.

## Communication

Each quarter a Slack reminder will go out in #people-manager-and-above channel to review the next quarter calendar events. Each month shows `Task`, which outlines the people manager responsibility associated with the specific program, and (if applicable) highlights the `Key Date`. We will also leverage our Manager Newsletter and the Company Newsletter for broadcasting our programs widely.
