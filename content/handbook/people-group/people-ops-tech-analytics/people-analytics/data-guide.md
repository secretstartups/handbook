## Objectives for this page

This handbook page provides an overview of data definitions and data models used by the People Analytics team. Use this page for clarification on terminology, calculations, or models that use People data. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to someone from the team for help.

## Helpful places to start

- [DBT Docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/overview) - This resource contains comprehensive documentation on all available dbt models. This is a great starting point to understanding our models. For specific People Models, please reference the **Commonly Used Data Models** section below for a starting point.
- [Definitive guides to data subject areas](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/) managed by the Data team.
- [Documentation on data pipelines](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/pipelines/) for the technically curious analyst. This page goes into each data source and extraction details.
- [People Group Tech Stack Guide]({{< ref "tech-stack-guide-workday" >}}) for overview of all the integrations that go into and out of our HR systems and all the tools we use.

## Data Models

The Data Team is working with the People Analytics team to build data marts that allow users to explore our different people data sources

- "mart" models are a combination of dimensions and facts that are joined together to enable easy analysis.
- "rpt" ("report") models are built with specific business logic for a specific use case.

Underneath each model is a clean lineage of dimensions and facts that can also be used for analysis. This list included all the prep tables, dimensions and facts that have been created for people analysis as well as the ones that we are planning to build in the upcoming quarters based on the [Team Member Common ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/17fbbbe5-f652-40e9-905e-1b07ec040520/edit?viewport_loc=153%2C6%2C1472%2C542%2CC6RZ78OfF1Bh&invitationId=inv_f6b923fd-02bb-4786-abd7-bf205c7d1da2)

## Model usage

### dim_team_member

This table contains team members work and personal information. Sensitive columns are masked using [dynamic masking](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#dynamic-masking) and the fields are only visible by team members with the **analyst_people** role assigned in Snowflake. This table is a [hybrid SCD (Type 1 + Type 2)](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/edw/#slowly-changing-dimensions--snapshots).

The table includes information regarding current team members, new hires who have records created in Workday before their start date and team members who were terminated in 2021 onwards. Team members who were terminated before 2021 are not captured in this model at this time. The grain of this table is one row per **employee_id** per **valid_to/valid_from** combination.
