title: "Data Guide to People Data Analysis"
---

## Objectives for this page

This handbook page is intended to provide a high-level overview of the most common data models used by the People Analytics team. If you are in need of using People Data for dashboard development and reporting, this page will help you determine the best models to use. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to someone from the team for help.

## Helpful places to start

- [DBT Docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/overview) - This resource contains comprehensive documentation on all available dbt models. This is a great starting point to understanding our models. For specific People Models, please reference the **Commonly Used Data Models** section below for a starting point.
- [Definitive guides to data subject areas](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#definitive-guides) managed by the Data team.
- [Documentation on data pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/pipelines/) for the technically curious analyst. This page goes into each data source and extraction details.
- [People Group Tech Stack Guide]({{< ref "tech-stack-guide-workday" >}}) for overview of all the integrations that go into and out of our HR systems and all the tools we use.

## Key Terms

**BambooHR** - BambooHR was the HRIS used by GitLab until 2022-06-16

**Workday** - Workday is the HRIS used by GitLab since 2022-06-16

## Team Members

**Employee ID** - Unique number that has been assigned to each individual team member within the company

**Team Member** - Full time individuals working for GitLab. Team members can be hired through an entity, PEO or direct contract. Individuals are considered team members in the warehouse when on an indefinite term contract with GitLab. Temporary Service Providers or Contingent Workers (working for GitLab for a limited period of time) are not tracked in Workday, therefore their records don't exist in Snowflake

## Teams

**Organization** - An organization refers to a grouping used to organize team members or other organizations

**Team ID** - The unique organization identifier

**Team Superior ID** Organization's superior team ID

**Department** - The second level of the GitLab organization hierarchy

**Division** - The top level of the GitLab organization hierarchy

**Cost Center** - The reported top level cost center for the team member

## Data Sources

### BambooHR

BambooHR was used by GitLab to store all team member information in one central location.

### Greenhouse

GitLab’s ATS (Applicant Tracking System). All hiring managers and interviewers will use Greenhouse to review resumes, provide feedback, communicate with candidates, and more. Please refer to the [hiring handbook](/handbook/hiring/greenhouse/) for additional information.

### Time Off by Deel

A slack application used to request, track, approve and analyze time off.

### Workday

[Workday](/handbook/people-group/workday/tech-stack-guide-workday/) is GitLab's current central HRIS.

### CultureAmp

The application we use to conduct surveys within GitLab.

## Data Models

The Data Team is working with the People Analytics team to build data marts that allow users to explore our different people data sources

- "mart" models are a combination of dimensions and facts that are joined together to enable easy analysis.
- "rpt" ("report") models are built with specific business logic for a specific use case.

Underneath each model is a clean lineage of dimensions and facts that can also be used for analysis. This list included all the prep tables, dimensions and facts that have been created for people analysis as well as the ones that we are planning to build in the upcoming quarters based on the [Team Member Common ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/17fbbbe5-f652-40e9-905e-1b07ec040520/edit?viewport_loc=153%2C6%2C1472%2C542%2CC6RZ78OfF1Bh&invitationId=inv_f6b923fd-02bb-4786-abd7-bf205c7d1da2)

## Model usage

### dim_team_member

This table contains team members work and personal information. Sensitive columns are masked using [dynamic masking](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#dynamic-masking) and the fields are only visible by team members with the **analyst_people** role assigned in Snowflake. This table is a [hybrid SCD (Type 1 + Type 2)](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/edw/#slowly-changing-dimensions--snapshots).

The table includes information regarding current team members, new hires who have records created in Workday before their start date and team members who were terminated in 2021 onwards. Team members who were terminated before 2021 are not captured in this model at this time. The grain of this table is one row per **employee_id** per **valid_to/valid_from** combination.

## Legacy and Other Data Models

Legacy models are models we will be transitioning from at some point but are still being used for reporting.

### Legacy Workday/BambooHR Data Models

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Click to expand</summary>

| Database | Schema | Table Name | Data Grain | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prod | legacy | [employee_directory_analysis](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.employee_directory_analysis) | `employee_id` by `date_actual` | Gives the current state of the employees at GitLab at any point of time. This is the model to use for headcount, team size, or any people-related analysis for employees. This has current and past employees, as well as their department, division, and cost center and hire/termination dates. | |
| prod | legacy | [bamboohr_rpt_headcount_aggregation](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.bamboohr_rpt_headcount_aggregation) | `department`, `division`, `eeoc_value` | This report creates out a headcount report from the bamboohr_headcount_intermediate to be used for Sisense dashboards for each month. | The division reporting is based on current division used. |
| prep | sensitive | [employee_directory_intermediate](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.employee_directory_intermediate) | `employee_id` by `date_actual` | INCLUDES SENSITIVE INFORMATION. The master collection of all info about GitLab employees for their latest position. | |
| prep | sensitive | [bamboohr_employment_status_xf](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.bamboohr_employment_status_xf) | `employee_id` by `valid_from_date` | This model provides a transaction record of an employee's status changes (i.e. active, leave, termed). It helps identify when an employee is re-hired, and provides termination type | |
| prep | sensitive | [bamboohr_promotions_xf](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.bamboohr_promotions_xf) | `employee_id` by `promotion_date` and `compensation_sequence` | This model identifies all individuals that were promoted and the compensation change associated to the promotion. The total compensation change is equal to the change in compensation (from bamboohr_compensation model) times the pay frequency and currency conversion at time of promotion + change in OTE(USD) at time of promotion. In the case the team member is hourly, we use the bamboohr_currency_conversion table. | |
| prep | sensitive | [bamboohr_id_employee_number_mapping](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.bamboohr_id_employee_number_mapping) | `employee_id` | This model is the canonical source mapping bamboo employee numbers with employee IDs. It includes all employees for all time. The model also captures demographic information, and removes test accounts. | |
| prep | sensitive | [bamboohr_separations](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.bamboohr_separations) | `employee_id` | Provides a report of all separated team members. | |
| prep | sensitive | [workday_terminations](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.workday_terminations) | `employee_id` | Provides the termination reason, and exit impact to allow the People Analytics team to accurately report on termination data | |
| prep | workday | [blended_directory_source](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.blended_directory_source) | `employee_id` by `uploaded_at` and `source_system` | Daily upload of employee data used for downstream models. | Helpful source for auditing any data issues in Snowflake |

### Greenhouse Data Models

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Click to expand</summary>

| Database | Schema | Table Name | Data Grain | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prod | workspace_people | [rpt_hires](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.rpt_hires) | `application_id` | This is a report specifically for talent acquisition and counts accepted offers as hires. |  |
| prep | greenhouse | [greenhouse_application_stages_source](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.greenhouse_application_stages_source) | `application_id` by `stage_id` and `stage_entered_on` | This table is Historical activity of all stages an application can be in Each row represents a stage that an application can be in, and the timestamp that the application entered and exited the stage Things to note: This table contains a row for each stage that an application can be in (taken from the job that the application is on). Thus, there may be rows for stages that an application has yet to reach, or will not reach (if the application was rejected). |  |
| prep | sensitive | [greenhouse_recruiting_xf](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.greenhouse_recruiting_xf) | `application_id` | This is shows all applications submitted and ties in offer data, greenhouse department (the associated division), and source data to be in 1 place. |  |
