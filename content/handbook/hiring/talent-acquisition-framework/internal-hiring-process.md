## Team Member Responsibilities

- Meet with your current manager to discuss the internal opportunity you’d like to pursue prior to submitting your application.

- Ensure you have met your department specific eligibility requirements:
   - Guidelines for performance eligibility:
      - Team members who are assessed at a Performing or Exceeding Performance level during Talent Assessment are eligible to be considered for another role
      - Team members whose Performance is assessed as Developing or are actively undergoing written performance management, may not be eligible. These situations require manager and/or PBP approval to proceed.
      - Team members that have not had a Talent Assessment require manager and/or PBP approval to proceed
   - Time in role eligibility will be 6 months in current role. Exceptions to this:
      - Job Family specialty changes
      - Business Impact  (revenue-dependencies, interim role to perm)
      - Business driven transfers (example of realignments)
      - SDR 12 months in role
- Important things to consider when applying:
   1. Ensure the opportunity aligns with your career goals here at GitLab
   1. Ensure you have discussed compensation and leveling with the recruiter and/or hiring manager for the open role you are interested in and applying for
   1. While you may apply to a role with a higher job grade and title, there may be situations (moving from one job family to another for example) where the higher job grade may not align with your current competencies and skillset that is required for the role. If the hiring team does choose to move forward with an offer, in these cases, it's likely a higher job grade and title will not be given.
