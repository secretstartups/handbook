title: Laptop Recycling and Refurbishing
---

## Overview

We use [SIPI Asset Recovery](https://www.sipicorp.com/itad/) for devices that need to be recycled/returned.  At GitLab Corporate Security's discretion, laptops may also be sent to an Corporate Security team member for repurposing. Either way, GitLab Corporate Security will provide a shipping label and box upon request at no cost to yourself.

If the Corporate Security department has record of a current litigation hold for the offboarded employee, IT will consult with Legal before proceeding.

All team member laptops must be securely [wiped](/handbook/security/corporate/services/laptops/wipe) before being returned. This not only protects the company, but also protects you since it is possible for personal information to exist on these machines.

Reformatting a computer is not sufficient in these cases because it is possible for sensitive data to be recovered after reinstalling an operating system.
