## <i class="fas fa-rocket" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Security Vision and Mission

Our vision is to transparently lead the world to secure outcomes.

Our mission is to enable everyone to innovate and succeed on a safe, secure, and trusted DevSecOps platform. This will be achieved through 5 security operating principles:

1. Accelerate business success with a focus on:
   - Prioritize ‘boring’, iterative solutions that minimize risk
   - Find ways to say Yes
   - Understand goals before recommending solutions
   - Use GitLab first
1. Efficient operations with a focus on:
   - Technical controls over handbook rules
   - Leverage automation first (robots over humans)
   - Responsible decisions (Spending, Tooling, Staffing, etc) over low ROI (return on investment) decisions
   - Reusable or repeatable over singular solutions
1. Transparency with a focus on:
   - Responsible protection of MNPI (material non-public information)
   - Evangelize [dogfooding]({{< ref "values#dogfooding" >}}) of GitLab publicly
   - Lead with metrics
   - Balance security with usefulness
1. Risk Reduction with a focus on:
   - Secure by default
   - Preventative controls over detective controls
   - Solving root causes over treating symptoms
   - Visibility through Coverage, Discoverability, Observability
1. Collaborative Culture with a focus on:
   - Working together on common solutions
   - Solve shared problems with shared solutions
   - Simplifying language for everyone to understand
   - Avoiding security jargon
   - Seek opportunities to help others succeed

To help achieve the vision of transparently leading the world to secure outcomes, the Security Division has nominated a [Security Culture Committee]({{< ref "security-culture" >}}).

### Division Structure

The Security Division provides essential security operational services, is directly engaged in the development and release processes, and offers consultative and advisory services to better enable the business to function while minimising risk.

To reflect this, we have structured the Security Division around four key tenets, which drive the structure and the activities of our group. These are :

#### Secure the Product - The Security Engineering Department

The [Security Engineering Department]({{< ref "security-engineering" >}}) is primarily focused on Securing the Product. This reflects the Security Division's current efforts to be involved in the Application development and Release cycle for Security Releases, Security Research, our HackerOne bug bounty program, Security Automation, External Security Communications, and Vulnerability Management.

The term “Product” is interpreted broadly and includes the GitLab application itself and all other integrations and code that is developed internally to support the GitLab application for the multi-tenant SaaS. Our responsibility is to ensure all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards, and to be proactive and responsive to ensure world-class security in anything GitLab offers.


#### Protect the Company - The Security Operations Department

[Security Operations Department]({{< ref "security-operations" >}}) teams are primarily focused on protecting GitLab the business and GitLab's platform. This encompasses protecting company property as well as to prevent, detect and respond to risks and events targeting the business and our platform. This department includes the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and the Trust and Safety team.

These functions have the responsibility of shoring up and maintaining the security posture of GitLab's platform to ensure enterprise-level security is in place to protect our new and existing customers.

#### Lead with Data - The Threat Management Department

[Threat Management Department]({{< ref "threat-management" >}}) teams are cross-functional. They are responsible for collaborating across the Security Division to identify, communicate, and remediate threats or vulnerabilities that may impact GitLab, our Team Members or our users and the community at large.

#### Assure the Customer - The Security Assurance Department

The [Security Assurance Department]({{< ref "security-assurance" >}}) is comprised of the teams noted above. They target Customer Assurance projects among their responsibilities. This reflects the need for us to provide resources to our customers to assure them of the security and safety of GitLab as an application to use within their organisation and as a enterprise-level SaaS. This also involves providing appropriate support, services and resources to customers so that they trust GitLab as a Secure Company, as a Secure Product, and Secure SaaS



#### Other groups and individuals

##### Security Program Management

Security Program Management is responsible for complete overview and driving security initiatives across Product, Engineering, and Business Enablement. This includes the tracking, monitoring, and influencing priority of significant security objectives, goals, and plans/roadmaps from all security sub-departments.

### <i id="biz-tech-icons" class="fas fa-users"></i> Contacting the Team

#### Reporting vulnerabilities and security issues

For information regarding GitLab's [HackerOne bug bounty program]({{< ref "hackerone-process" >}}), and creating and scheduling security issues, please see our [engaging with security]({{< ref "engaging-with-security" >}}) page and our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/security/disclosure/).

#### Reporting an Incident

If an urgent security incident has been identified or you suspect an incident may have occurred, please refer to [Engaging the Security Engineer On-Call]({{< ref "engaging-security-on-call" >}}).  Examples include, but are not limited to:
 - Lost or stolen devices
 - Leaked credentials
 - Endpoint compromise or infection
 - Exposure of sensitive GitLab data

GitLab provides a `panic@gitlab.com` email address for team members to use in situations when Slack is inaccessible and immediate security response is required.

This email address is only accessible to GitLab team members and can be reached from their gitlab.com or personal email address as listed in Workday. Using this address provides an excellent way to limit the damage caused by a loss of one of these devices.

Additionally if a GitLab team member experiences a personal emergency the People Group also provides an [emergency contact email](/handbook/people-group/#in-case-of-emergency).

#### Ransomware

For an overview of the communication and response process for a suspected ransomware attack, please see our [Responding to Ransomware]({{< ref "responding-to-ransomware" >}}) page.

-----

### Important topics

#### Tokens

The following best practices will help ensure tokens are handled appropriately at GitLab. For detailed requirements regarding the use of tokens at GitLab, please see our [token management standard]({{< ref "token-management-standard" >}}).

1. When creating a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html), be sure to choose the appropriate [scopes](/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/engaging-security-on-call.html) that only have the permissions that are absolutely necessary.
1. Oftentimes a [Project Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html) might be sufficient instead of a Personal Access Token. Project Access Tokens have a much more limited scope and should be preferred over Personal Access Tokens whenever possible.
1. Always set an expiration for your tokens when creating them. Tokens should preferably expire in a matter of hours or a day.
1. Be mindful to keep these personal access tokens secret. Be particularly careful not to accidentally commit them in configuration files, paste them into issue or merge request comments, or otherwise expose them.
1. Please consider periodically reviewing your currently active Personal Access Tokens and revoking any that are no longer needed.
1. Personal Access Tokens will be highly discouraged within the GitLab production environment, and disallowed/disabled wherever possible. Existing tokens shall remain, but additional issuance will not be permissible/possible.
1. If you believe a personal access token has been leaked, revoke it immediately (if possible) and [contact the security team](/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/engaging-security-on-call.html) using the `/security` Slack command.


### Security Releases

GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/). You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts [here](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/). In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=security&scope=all&state=opened) 30 days after the release in which they were patched.

#### Timing of the monthly security release

Our team targets release of the scheduled, monthly security release around the 28th, or 6-10 days after the [monthly feature release](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/) and communicates the release via [blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and email notification to subscribers of our [security notices](/handbook/company/contact/).

#### Receive notification of security releases

- To receive security release blog notifications delivered to your inbox, visit our [contact us](/handbook/company/contact/) page.
- To receive release notifications via RSS, subscribe to our [security release RSS feed](https://about.gitlab.com/security-releases.xml) or our [RSS feed for all releases](https://about.gitlab.com/all-releases.xml).

#### Security release related documentation

- Further definition, process and checklists for security releases are described
in the
[release/docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/process.md)
project.
- The policies for backporting changes follow [Security Releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html#security-releases)
for GitLab EE.
- For critical security releases, refer to [Critical Security Releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/process.md#critical-security-releases) in `release/docs`.

#### Tools

- [Incident-Tools (private)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/incident-tools)
for working scripts and other code during or while remediating an incident.
If the tool is applicable outside of the `GitLab.com` environment, consider
if it's possible to release when the `~security` issue becomes
non-confidential. This group can also be used for private demonstration projects for
security issues.
- [security-tools (mostly private)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/security-tools/) contains some
operational tools used by the security teams. Contents and/or configurations
require that most of these projects remain private.

#### Other Frequently Used GitLab.com Projects

Security crosses many teams in the company, so you will find `~security` labelled
issues across all GitLab projects, especially:

- [gitlab-foss](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/)
- [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/)
- [infrastructure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/)
- [production](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/)

When opening issues, please follow the [Creating New Security Issues]({{ ref "engaging-with-security#creating-new-security-issues" }}) process for using labels and the confidential flag.

#### AI in Security Learning Group

This group is setup to help interested Security team members get up to speed with AI technologies and how to secure them. For more information, see the [AI in Security Learning Group page]({{< ref "learning-group-ai" >}}).

### Issue Triage

The Security team needs to be able to communicate the priorities of security related issues to the Product, Development, and Infrastructure teams. Here's how the team can set priorities internally for subsequent communication (inspired in part by how the [support team does this]({{< ref "working-with-issues" >}})).







### Internal Application Security Reviews

For systems built (or significantly modified) by Departments that house customer and other sensitive data, the Security Team should perform applicable application security reviews to ensure the systems are hardened. Security reviews aim to help reduce vulnerabilities and to create a more secure product.

#### When to request a security review?

This short questionnaire below should help you in quickly deciding if you should engage the [application security team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec):

If the change is doing one or more of the following:

1. Processing, storing, or transferring any kind of [RED or ORANGE data]({{< ref "data-classification-standard" >}})
1. If your changes have a goal which requires a **cryptographic function** such as: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, or non-repudiation, it *should* be reviewed by the [application security team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec).
1. Deployment of a customer facing application into a new environment
1. Changes to an existing security control
1. Modification of any pipeline security checks or scans
1. A new authentication mechanism
1. Adding code that touches the authentication model, tokens or sessions
1. Dealing with user supplied data
1. Touching cryptography functions, see the [GitLab Cryptography Standard]({{< ref "cryptographic-standard" >}}) for more details
1. Touching the permission model
1. Implement new security controls (i.e. new library for a specific protection, HTTP header, ...)
1. Exposing a new API endpoint, or modifying an existing one
1. Introducing new database queries
1. Using regex to :
  - validate user supplied data
  - make decisions related to authorisation and authentication
1. A new feature that can manipulate or display sensitive data (i.e PII), see our [Data Classification Standard]({{< ref "data-classification-standard" >}}) for more details
1. Persisting sensitive data such as tokens, crypto keys, credentials, PII in temp storages/files/DB, manipulating or displaying sensitive data (i.e PII), see our [Data Classification Standard]({{< ref "data-classification-standard" >}}) for more details

You should engage `@gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec`.

#### How to request a security review?

There are two ways to request a security review depending on how significant the changes are. It is divided between individual merge requests and larger scale initiatives.

##### Individual merge requests or issues

Loop in the application security team by `/cc @gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec` in your merge request or issue.

These reviews are intended to be faster, more lightweight, and have a lower barrier of entry.

##### Larger scale initiatives

To get started, create an issue in the [internal application security reviews repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec/appsec-reviews/issues) using the [Appsec Review template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec/appsec-reviews/-/issues/new?issueable_tempalte=AppSec%20Review). The complete process can be found at [here](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/appsec-reviews.html).

Some use cases of this are for epics, milestones, reviewing for a common security weakness in the entire codebase, or larger features.

#### Is security approval required to progress?

No, code changes do *not* require security approval to progress. Non-blocking reviews enables the freedom for our code to [keep shipping]({{< ref "ceo#how-do-we-keep-shipping" >}}) fast, and it closer aligns with our values of [iteration and efficiency]({{< ref "values#iteration" >}}). They operate more as guardrails instead of a gate.

#### What should I provide when requesting a security review?

To help speed up a review, it's recommended to provide any or all of the following:

- The background and context of the changes being made.
- Any documentation or diagrams which help provide a clear understanding its purpose and use cases.
- The type of data it's processing or storing.
- The security requirements for the data.
- Your security concerns and a worst case scenario that could happen.
- A test environment.

#### What does the security process look like?

The current process for larger scale internal application security reviews be found [here]({{< ref "appsec-reviews" >}})

#### My changes have been reviewed by security, so is my project now secure?

Security reviews are not proof or certification that the code changes are secure. They are best effort, and additional vulnerabilities may exist after a review.

It's important to note here that application security reviews are not a one-and-done, but can be ongoing as the application under review evolves.

#### Using third party libraries ?

If you are using third party libraries make sure that:

1. You use the latest stable and available version
1. Your team has the ability to support and upgrade this library as security patches are published
1. The maintainer has a security policy
