### Frontend group calls

The frontend group has scheduled weekly calls every Tuesday, before the company call. During this call, team members are encouraged to share
information that may be relevant to share with other members synchronously (Eg. new documentation change, new breaking changes added to `master`).

To help identify possible conflict areas in a release we encourage members to post a link to a comment in an issue that you’re working on that crosses the borders of the domain of your stage group that you feel has the potential of colliding with the work of others.

#### Frontend themed call

We started in January 2018, with adding a monthly theme to the first call of each month. The purpose of these themes is to add some
fun and quirkiness to our team calls (so that we can learn more about each other) but it shouldn't distract or derail into too much off-topic conversation.

**How does it work**
- Winner of the previous theme will determine the theme of the next month
- Theme will be announced a few weeks before the next month
- Everyone in the call should write down who they think is the winner in the zoom chat and reveal it all at once (to prevent voting bias) during the voting

### Frontend calendar

The frontend Google Calendar was created as a means of unifying and including team members on frontend related discussions.
Frontend meetings should be listed on the calendar unless there is a good reason not to.
Frontend engineers have the calendar permissions to create events on this calendar while GitLab team-members have the permissions to add the frontend calendar to their calendar.

> Note: Due to a bug on Google Calendar, team members are unable to find the calendar by searching.
Team members are recommended to go to the [frontend calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV83dHQ0bDA1NWg1MGRndWNpZDBidGg1ZGZsOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
on their browser to add this calendar to their calendar. This calendar is currently only available within GitLab and is not publicly accessible.

### RFCs for changes to GitLab Frontend

If you would like to propose a new, or a change to an existing, frontend pattern in our codebase, please create an issue in [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/rfcs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/rfcs) so that we can discuss it.
