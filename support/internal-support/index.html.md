title: Working With GitLab Support
description: How GitLab team members can work with and best ways to contact Support.
---

## Overview

The purpose of this page is to direct GitLab team members outside of Support on what GitLab Support does, how to get in contact with us, and where to direct common requests that require our involvement. **Are you a customer looking for technical support? If so, please visit the [Support Page](/support/) instead.**

## GitLab Support's Purpose

GitLab Support provides technical support GitLab.com and Self-Managed GitLab customers. We do **not** provide support for GitLab team members who are experiencing IT (1Password, Slack, Mac, etc.) issues. If you require assistance with issues of that nature, please contact [Team Member Enablement](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/self-help-troubleshooting/).

## Should I Contact GitLab Support?

For general questions regarding GitLab ("Can GitLab do x?", "How do I do y with GitLab?") please ask in [#questions](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/questions), or if you think you've encountered a bug or something isn't behaving right while using GitLab try asking in [#is-this-known](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CETG54GQ0). Doing so ensures that [everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission) to an answer. If you're not getting one and believe that Support is the best team to ask, try cross-posting your question in the [relevant GitLab Support channel](#on-slack).

However, keep in mind that those channels are specifically for questions *about* the various GitLab Support teams, not for questions about GitLab, the product. If you're working with a customer that requires technical support, please advise them to [contact GitLab Support](#requesting-support-for-customers).

### Support Team Meta Project

If you'd like to ask a longer term or larger scope question, propose an idea to GitLab Support, discuss something with us, or suggest an improvement or change to any of our workflows, please visit the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/issues) of the **[Support Team Meta](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta)** project and create an issue there. Please keep in mind that it is open to the community and as such **should not contain any sensitive information**, so links to Zendesk or other references are encouraged.

### On Slack

The following channels are where GitLab Support can be found on Slack and are the best places to reach us, depending on what you need.

- [#support_gitlab-com](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C4XFU81LG/) - This channel is specifically for the GitLab.com support team. They handle GitLab.com related tickets. It should be used if you have a quick question about the GitLab.com Support Team specifically.
- [#support_self-managed](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/support_self-managed/) - This channel is specifically for the self-managed support team. They handle self-managed production issues, triage bugs, and self-managed emergencies, among other things.
- [#support_licensing-subscription](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/support_licensing-subscription/) - This channel handles license and subscription issues.
- [#support_escalations](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CBVAE1L48/) - This channel is for support escalations and other items which require support managers' attention.
- [#feed_zd-main](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C1CKSUTL5/) - Feed of all self-managed Zendesk ticket activities.

In order to attract GitLab Support's attention on Slack, you can use the team handles, mentioning multiple team members in a message or a thread where our [**urgent** attention](/handbook/communication/#be-respectful-of-others-time) is needed. Support team handles are:

- `@support-selfmanaged` - Self-managed support team members.
- `@support-dotcom` - GitLab.com support team members.
- `@supportmanagers` - Support director and managers.

## Support Tickets & Customer Information

### Requesting Support for Customers

If your customer contacts you requiring technical support, there are two good options available to you:

1. (Recommended) In most cases, please direct them to open a ticket through the Support Portal. It is Support's primary function to provide technical support for our customers, and as paid users, they are entitled to access to us. This option is recommended as the customer is best positioned to describe their own issue and needs. Ensure that the customer understands that it will almost always be the fastest path to response to reach out to support directly, cc'ing in their technical account manager, as the support team operates within a 24/7 model, unlike any other team at GitLab.

1. In sensitive cases in which asking a customer to open a ticket would aggravate a situation, you can open a support ticket. Please ensure first that you aren't logged into Zendesk with a light agent account. If you are, a straightforward workaround is to use a private/incognito window in your browser-of-choice to submit the ticket. When submitting the ticket, in the "Your email address" field, enter your customer's email address.

If you'd like to be CC'd on the ticket, please make sure you request it on the ticket body.

### Requesting support for GitLab.com users that have account or login issues

GitLab.com users that have account or login issues should [open a new ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
They should select "GitLab.com (SaaS) User Accounts and Login Issues" as the reason for the request.

### Requesting Customer Information

According to our [privacy policies](/privacy/), Support will not provide any information regarding customers, groups, projects, etc, to you that are not available publicly. This includes situations where a customer is requesting information about their own projects, groups, etc. If they are unable to authenticate, we cannot assume they are who they say they are. If they are locked out, please have them submit a support ticket.

### Viewing Support Tickets

All GitLab Team Members can request a 'Light Agent' account so that you can see customer tickets in Zendesk and leave notes for the Support team. These accounts are free.

To request a Light Agent Zendesk account, please send an email to `gitlablightagent.2lba7m@zapiermail.com` - you'll receive an automated reply with the result of your request. **You must send your request from your GitLab Google / Gmail account. No other addresses will work.** The Subject and Body fields of the email can be empty. Once set up, you'll need to wait 24 hours for your account to be assigned Zendesk in Okta. Once Zendesk is assigned, you should be able to [log in](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent). If you don't get your account assigned within this period, please reach out to #support-operations in Slack. In most cases, people who don't get access within the 24 hours already had an end-user account which prevents the automation from working as expected.

You cannot send public replies to customers with a Light Agent account - if you need to do this, please submit a [new Access Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request) for a paid full agent account. If needed, you can [read more information](https://www.zendesk.com/company/collaboration-add-on-additional-features/) on Light Agent accounts from Zendesk.

> **NOTE**: Support will not start a trial. If one is needed, *have the user initiate a normal trial first*.

| Request    | What To Do                                                   |

Grace period extensions are also treated similarly to trial extensions for self-managed. For GitLab.com, the customer should start a trial once their subscription has expired. To request these for either self-managed or GitLab.com, create a trial extension issue and update the title accordingly to indicate that it is an existing customer.

Please consider the following:

1. A previous trial needs to exist for the customer. If no trial was created at any point a trial can be created by the customer the following day as the plan expires.
1. We can provide grace period extensions as long as the current plan is not ongoing, in other words, if the plan expires on the 15th, we can increase the grace period starting the next day. please plan accordingly.

#### GitLab.com Billable Members List

As Product has implemented the minimal viable versions of [#27074](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/27074) and [#35454](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35454), Support is beginning to deprecate this process. You can also see [epic 4547](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4547) for improvements that product is working on and their progress.

##### Self-serve options for GitLab team members

Here are some options to get basic seat count information:

1. *Plan* and *Seats Currently in Use*:
    - [chatops](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/chatops_on_gitlabcom.html#chatops-on-gitlabcom) (requires dev.gitlab.org account) with the command: `/chatops run namespace find group-path`
2. Info from 1 plus Subscription (or trial) *End Date*
    - [Sisense dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/576469/Namespace-Overview) (changing the namespace ID filter)
3. Info from 2 plus *Seats in Subscription*, *Max Seats Used*, and *Start Date*
    - [Customers portal admin](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer) (requires access via Okta)

##### Options for customer

> **Note:** The public facing version of this information is on the [Licensing and subscription FAQ page](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/#how-can-i-get-a-list-of-billable-users-for-my-plan).

Customers can get their subscription information and a list of users using a seat on their group's **Billing** page (under the group **Settings**) .

Alternative methods:

1. [Billable members API endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#list-all-billable-members-of-a-group)
1. [glgl tool's rollcall script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/glgl) which will provide the subgroup or project where a user has been added.
*Note:* This project has been archived and will no longer be updated.

If none of those options work and a report detailing which users are a part of the group is required, the request **MUST** be made directly by the customer through the [Support Portal](https://support.gitlab.com).

The Support Engineer working the ticket will:

1. Authenticate their identity by asking them to perform an action (such as create a Snippet with specific text).
1. Generate the report.
1. Password protect the report and send it along in the ticket.
1. Send the password in a separate email.

##### Billable members internal request

If *none* of these above are options for your case, open a [billable members internal request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=billable%20members) with the `Billable members` template.

> **Note:** Support will only provide you with a screenshot of the billing page's subscription info. This includes:

- Plan, and if it is a trial
- Seats in subscription, currently in use, max used, owed
- Subscription Start and End dates

---

### I Want to Escalate a Ticket

Please see the dedicated [Support Escalations](/handbook/support/internal-support/support-escalations.html) page.

---

### Other

#### Trials and Prospect Support

By default, [trial licenses do not include support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/#trials-support).

If you've been contacted by a prospect whose evaluation of GitLab includes evaluating support expertise or SLA performance, as a member of the Sales team **you can grant temporary support for their trial license**. Please note this is only available for 60 days maximum. After that point, the account will be downgraded back to the standard levels for a trial/prospect.

You can do this via Salesforce in a few simple steps:

1. Browse to the organization's Salesforce record, locate the field titled `Manual Support Upgrade` and add a check mark.
1. Add a contact record in Salesforce for each person in the organization who you want to be able to submit and work support tickets.
1. Instruct your prospect to [open a new case](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) via the web support portal and after selecting the reason for reaching out (whether self-managed or SaaS) be sure to ask that they select `Sales assisted trial` as their subscription level from the relevant dropdown menu.

#### Important Additional Notes

{:.no_toc}

1. There is no need to contact the Support team - selecting `Manual Support Upgrade` will mean your prospect's tickets automatically get the correct SLA.
1. Please wait for at least two hours after enabling the support upgrade before submitting a ticket to allow Salesforce and Zendesk to synchronize.
1. Prospects who have been granted a temporary support upgrade receive [Priority Support SLAs](/support/#priority-support).
1. Although the Support and Sales teams regularly review the list of prospects who have been granted a temporary support upgrade to ensure only active prospects are selected, **please uncheck the `Manual Support Upgrade` field when the trial ends.**.
1. We are working with Sales Operations to put a limit on the maximum number of `Manual Support Upgrades`. This page will be updated when that work is completed.

#### My customer is having trouble applying their GitLab.com subscription

The customer has more than likely run into an issue during the purchase process, or is unaware how to apply their subscription to their group. The following documentation outlines how to subscribe to GitLab.com, link their GitLab.com account to [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com), and apply that subscription to their group.

- [Obtain a GitLab Subscription](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/#obtain-a-gitlab-subscription)
- [Manage Your GitLab Account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/#manage-your-gitlab-account)

#### Users in an account I own would like more visibility into their organization's support tickets

In some cases, certain organizations want all members of their organization to be able to see all of the support tickets that have been logged.
In other cases, a particular user from the account would like to be able to see and respond to all tickets from their organization.
If you'd like to enable this, please:

1. Ask the customer to submit a Support ticket using the [Support Ops form](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001801419) and select `Shared organization requests` in the `Problem type` field.
1. Once the ticket is created, Support Ops will review and work on the ticket. 

**Note:** If a customer submits a shared organization request using a different Support form, simply change the form to `Support Ops` and select `Shared organization requests` in the `Problem type` field. Support Ops will then review the ticket and ask any followup questions if necessary. 

#### My customer needs a report of all the users within their group(s) structure

To view the group's number of billable members, a member of the group with `Owner` permissions may visit the **Settings -> Billing** section of it to see a breakdown. The number of billable members is the amount listed under `Seats currently in use` and this is the amount that will come up whenever they link their group to a paid subscription. Billable members [consist of every user](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/#who-gets-counted-in-the-subscription) who is added to a group, subgroup, or project within a paid namespace with the only exception being Guest users within a namespace on certain subscription levels.

We have a [billable members API endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#list-all-billable-members-of-a-group) that will produce a list of all the billable members for the group. This must be run with your own PAT.

All the billable members are also currently displayed on the group billing page in an unsorted list. This is a first iteration; if interested, you can view the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4547) to see the planned work. If you have any feedback on the billable members list or want to request functionality or UI changes that are not planned in the epic, please feel free to leave a comment on the epic.

#### I want to add important information about the organization/user

Zendesk has the ability to store Organization and User notes. Using Zendesk
triggers, we put these into each ticket submitted by that organization or
user. If there is important information you wish to have included in tickets
for an organization or user, please create an issue under the
[support-ops-project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project/)
using the [Add Zendesk Organization Notes or Tags Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Add%20Zendesk%20Organization%20Notes%20or%20Tags%20Request)
template. Please be sure to indicate whether the information is only valid
for a specific period of time so that we may include that fact in the notes.

Examples of some notes you might want added:

- You want to put the SA's name on there for use in the tickets.
- A customer prefers specific titles be used when addressing them.
- An organization has multiple subscriptions.
