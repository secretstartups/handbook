## General Product Organizational Structure

The GitLab Product team includes team members at various levels of [Product Management job titles](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/product-CDF-competencies/) across our [organizational levels](/company/team/structure/#levels) with scope at various points in our [product hierarchy](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy). As a result there can be instances where peers across layers don't have the same title. We will always abide by [GitLab's layer structure](/company/team/structure/#layers).

| Level | Job Families | Hierarchy Scopes |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| IC | [Product Manager](/job-families/product/product-manager/) | Group, Stage |
| Manager | [Group Manager Product](/job-families/product/product-management-leadership/#group-manager-product-gmp), [Director of Product](/job-families/product/director-of-product/) | Collection of Groups, Stage, Section |

## Product Manager/Leader Collaboration

As a [product team leader](#product-leaders), it's important to set the tone for the organization.
We put our PMs individually in the forefront as
[Directly Responsible Individuals (DRI)](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/),
with the trust and power that they can make the right decisions with our support as
product leaders. This section is intended to outline some best practices for
working between PMs and their leaders. It contains guidance on responsibilities and
expectations the leader should have in working with PMs, but is not intended
to be hard and fast rules that take the place of having a strong working relationship
and prioritizing things effectively together.

**Note** - This is intended as a supplement to the [product director](/job-families/product/director-of-product/) or [group manager of product](/job-families/product/product-management-leadership/#group-manager-product-gmp)
job descriptions with specific focus on the interaction between PMs and their managers.
General job responsibilities can be found at that link.

An effective product leader should:

- Respect that multiple voices influencing the group will be confusing to the
execution team, and avoid coming out of left field with changing priorities.
The PM owns the [day-to-day interaction](/handbook/product/product-processes/#working-with-your-group)
with their group and the leader should influence through the directly responsible
PM.
- Work through your PMs as your path to success, rather than focusing on individual
achievement. We have a culture of empowering individual PMs, not centralizing
authority, and need to continue to reinforce that as we grow.
- Help your PMs understand who [important internal and external customers](/handbook/product/product-processes/#sensing-mechanisms)
are for them, ensuring that there's a productive ongoing dialogue with feedback
coming in and then features being adopted internally. [Internal customers](/handbook/values/#dogfooding)
should have at least a monthly check-in, with the internal customer section
in the category epic kept up to date.
- Represent their portfolio in day-to-day interaction with D and E groups, with
particular responsibility to prioritize inputs from leadership into something
stable in the short/medium term and actionable by the PMs, to align efforts
across teams, and to raise visibility of wins by the PM to the broader team
by being a "cheerleader" for the successes of their reports to the senior
leadership group. This also includes publishing portfolio-level directional
items that the rest of the company can use (and which should be reviewed and
understood by the DRI PMs who will deliver this portfolio-level vision.)
- Support and hold PMs accountable for updates to the next release, 3 month vision, OKRs, etc.
For teams using web category vision epics, this can be done in a very nice
monthly update flow aligned to the releases and done via discussion in a comprehensive
MR. Whatever the process, though, the leader should be holding the PM accountable
by providing support and guidance here, particularly when it comes to making sure
organizational priorities are clear. Make sure upcoming portfolio-level milestones,
due dates around releases, special projects with calendar impacts, etc. are visible
and always clearly communicated.
- Actively coach your PMs, sensing where they can grow and do better. This
coaching should be provided consistently, clearly, and in an actionable way, with
the intent of avoiding "surprise problems". In the same vein, following up on
requests for context, advice, and so on from the PMs is a priority. The
[socratic method](/company/team/structure/#management-group) is
recommended as a great approach that works particularly well with PMs.
- Prioritize hiring, being sure to include PMs (and EMs/team members) who will work
with the new person in the process.
- Provide structure and motivation for needed organizational changes (being more
[data-driven](/handbook/product/#data-driven-work),
telling stories, providing time for expansive thinking).
