#### Definitions of Qualifying Education Institutions and Associated Entities

**Qualified educational institution**: an institution that has been accredited by an authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal, or national government and has the primary purpose of affording instruction and conferring degrees. Qualified educational institutions can be public or private and must be non-profit/non-commercial.

The individual educational institution maybe organized under one corporate organization and government. Individual educational institutions generally have a uniquely identifiable email domain, governance, branding, degrees, administration, and colleges.

Individual institutions may be part of a larger state, regional, or national university system.

**University or Institution Campus**: individual educational institutions may have campuses located in a geographically separate locations from their main campus. The campus is generally a sub-unit of the main educational institution such that it reports to the same administration, uses the same email domain, has some level of shared degrees and services, and often the mascot and branding are shared.

**University College or University School**: a constituent unit or division of an educational institution. Generally, colleges are a collection of various related departments organized within its own governance within the wider educational institution structure. Colleges or schools may be named according to the types of degrees offered within the unit, for example, professional degrees or academic degrees. Colleges and schools are typically directly administered by a Dean that reports to the institution's governance.

**Research centers, institutes, and center-like units**: educational institutions commonly have a sub-unit organized around a specific research topic. These units may be the administrative home to faculty, students, and staff. Governance of the unit falls within the institution as a whole. Email domains, shared services, are all aligned with the primary institution.

**Stand-alone College**: this type of college is typically a stand-alone, entity smaller than a typical university, that emphasizes undergraduate education. Some colleges offer a broad range of academic areas while others specialize in professional or vocational training.  In this U.S., there are nearly 1,000 community colleges that offer 2-year associate degrees or 4-year degrees. Stand-alone colleges are considered in an individual educational institution for the purposes of this model.

The entity may be legally organized as a as a non-profit University or as a public-benefit corporation. Wholly online campuses or universities associated with a institution are considered an individual educational institution for the purposes of this model. The eligibility of wholly online campuses and universities will be determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the regional sales team.
