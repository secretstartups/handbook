## Design Pairs

Pair designing gives Product Designers a consistent partner to ideate with at the beginning of an effort and get feedback from during the design process, and conduct [design reviews](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#design-reviews). It also gives Product Designers exposure to product areas outside of their own.

* New designer pairs are connected every six months.
* Pairing assignments should comprise designers from different stages (e.g., a Plan designer should pair with someone outside of the Plan stage).
* If we have an odd number of designers, we'll have one 3-person partnership.
* Pairs decide what to share and when; there is no pre-defined schedule or guidelines.
* It's imperative to ask for feedback and give context.
