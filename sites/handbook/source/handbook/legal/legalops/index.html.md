## Legal & Corporate Affairs Billing Process

The purpose of this process is to streamline receiving and tracking invoices and accruals for outside counsel vendors. For more information about invoicing and payment, see the [Accounts Payable handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/accounts-payable/).

### Invoices

- All outside counsel invoices should be sent to <legalbilling@gitlab.com>.
- Upon receipt, Legal Operations updates the LACA Counsel Budget Tracker.
- DRIs review their invoices weekly, and approve or reject.
	- Approved invoices are sent to ap@gitlab.com by Legal Operations.
    - DRIs engage with outside counsel to discuss any rejected invoices. Upon resubmission, Legal Operations will update the tracker and submit to AP.

### Accruals

- Legal Operations sends a blanket request to all vendors on the 15th of the month requesting accruals be submitted by the 1st day of the following month. 
    - For example, for accruals of August 2023, the latest accruals should be provided to GitLab is 2023-09-01.
- Once accruals are received, Legal Operations logs and submits to FP&A.
    - DRIs can review for accuracy as needed/desired.
