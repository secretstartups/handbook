    2. And what else?
    3. What's the real challenge here for you?
    4. What do you want?
    5. How can I help?
    6. If you're saying Yes to this, what are you saying No to?
    7. What was most useful to you?
- Help me calibrate by leadership style by sharing with me what I should be doing more of/less of (I have thick skin, don't worry 😀)
- Please do not feel you have to wait for a 1:1 to bring anything up, my door/calendar is always open
