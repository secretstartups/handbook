# Field Marketing

The role of field marketing is to support marketing messages at a regional level through in-person and virtual interactions (quality vs. quantity) coupled with multi-touch activities. Field Marketing programs are focused on relationship building with customers and prospects to support land and expand opportunities as well as pulling pipeline through the funnel more quickly.

# Field Marketing Goals

- Sales Acceleration
    - Engaging with existing customers
    - New growth opportunities
- Demand
    - Education
- Market Intelligence
    - Test out new messaging or positioning 

# Types of Programs Field Marketing Runs

## GitLab Owned Field Events

### [GitLab Connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKwpNKoI4uU)

GitLab Connect is a full or half day event with both customers and prospects in attendance sharing stories & lessons learned about GitLab. SAL's will be responsible for asking customers to speak and Marketing, through a combination of SDR outreach, database and ad geotargeting will drive attendance to the event. If you would like to propose a GitLab Connect in your city, please follow [these instructions](/handbook/marketing/events/#suggesting-an-event) for requesting an event. Interested in seeing a GitLab Connect in action? [Check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKwpNKoI4uU)

### Field Marketing Owned Virtual Events

For information regarding process, epic codes, templates and more, please visit our [**Field Marketing Owned Virtual Events**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/) page.

## 3rd Party Events

We will sponsor regional 3rd party events in an effort to build the GitLab brand and also to gather leads. Different type of 3rd party events include, but are not limited to:

- DevOps Days
- Agile Events
- City run technology meetings
- Customer/prospect run DevOps events on invite
- Executive relationship building events via companies like Apex Assembly & Argyle Executive Forum

#### Executive Roundtables

Executive Roundtables can be run virtual or in-person and differ from webcasts/events mainly due to the size of the audience and the interactivity level. A roundtable is run as an open discussion between the host (usually 3rd party vendor), GitLab presenter and the audience. The host would open with an introduction of themselves and the topic for the session, then introduce the GitLab presenter and have them give an overview of GitLab followed by the host asking questions directly to specific people in the audience for them to openly answer and discuss. The advantage of a roundtable is that you can document the meeting more closely and understand more about an organization’s pains and problems.

Below are best practices when running a roundtable:

- Content creation - FMM to work with Sales Managers to decide on most relevant or hot topics in the region
- Speaker request - Put through a Strategic Marketing Support Request and fill out the template
- [Example of scripts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iy7AreiMM7seZM_EidixqdUw-OG__-cnl6pihqH72eY/edit#heading=h.btpndxf36cvl) for host and GitLab presenter
- [Example of meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2m3Izn66u9xuWGDHmR5_YJcWdUhKupfVlWVPjWGLL0/edit) to document conversations during the session
- Ensure questions are prepared between host and GitLab presenter beforehand to lead the conversations within the session
- Assign notes of each delegate to list leads for upload onto SFDC
- Pre-analysis of delegates - check to see if their organization is currently a user of GitLab, whether they’re CE or EE customers. This could be a great way to start or dig into deeper conversations with the delegate.

### How to operationally set up an in-person event

Field Marketing works closely with our Marketing Program Managers to functionally set up and execute our in person events. For complete details on our shared process, including the epic/issue creation process, please review our [event execution page](/handbook/marketing/events/#event-execution).

## Other Tactics

Being the marketing experts for the region, GitLab Field Marketers are also responsible for using other tactics to help generate leads to build pipeline. We have options such as survey tools, both of current employees and past employees based on the 3rd party vendor we use, webcasts, direct mailings, and also various digital tactics.

### Alyce Direct Mail

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Expand below to see details regarding Alyce Direct Mail</summary>

#### Overview
Alyce is a direct mail campaign used to land and accelerate deals to fuel pipeline progression using personalized gifts from information pulled via social media accounts as a thank you meeting with our Sales team. Our strategy will be limited to digital only during covid-19 using email campaigns, social media, and other SDR outreach methods until we can safely return to physical mailing as our prospects move back into the office.

We currently have an SOW the AMER FMM team is utilizing that includes the ability for 1,000 sends in a 180 day timeframe. At the end of the 180 days or upon completion of the 1,000 sends (which ever comes first), the AMER team will assess the results and decide if the team will renew. If you are outside of the AMER FMM team and are interested in using Alyce for our own campaign, please see section `Processing a New Alyce SOW and Campaign Setup`, below (NEED TO LINK).

Note: Gift recipients will always be able to donate the value of their gift to a meaningful charity or exchange for something different with equal or lesser value.

#### Regions that use Alyce
At this time, Alyce is only used by our AMER Field Marketing team via a pilot program.

#### Successful Usage
Strategic success is contingent upon close alignment and communication between Marketing and Sales. Alyce believes that prospecting by building rapport, earning trust and driving loyalty are the keys to success and have built their entire platform from this model. SDRs will leverage templates available in the Alyce tool that they are able to customize.

**We will work together to complete the following:**

- Determine our list of top prospects
- Create account-centric plan per SAL
- Understand Alyce platform and how to use it
- Review Alyce use-cases to optimize success

#### SDR Allocation per Gifting Rules

- MQL Score < 30 = $35 gift allowance
- MQL Score 31-75 = $50 gift allowance
- MQL Score 76-100 = Up to $100 gift allowance
- For a higher gift allowance a very specific justification should be presented and would need to be approved by FMM DRI

#### SDR Requirements for Booking IQMs via Alyce

- Meetings that are booked by SDR leveraging Alyce should use the following naming convention when creating an IQM Event: IQM - Prospect Name, Account Name - Alyce. This will allow FMM's and SDR Managers to filter reports by IQMs booked via Alyce platform.

#### Training and Helpful Videos
To be successful, there will be a series of training sessions to enable the Sales and Marketing team success.
- [Introductory Training/Sales Enablement](https://gitlab.zoom.us/rec/share/OgjnGu92hWJJO0wOD2YqFXQDEBt9VYIgDwOXbrQQBJBslvWAkbPWMxLPs0kgvRCC.2ioRU-qJbvioHhVJ?startTime=1596812685000)
- [SDR Enablement Training](https://gitlab.zoom.us/rec/share/1uDOxHhjx6C15dwko_u_6BdCK6L6tNtKJn52AK6Wwt3Q2_UifMa2jUEehedxHjMZ.WT9ikakQyMlfrFJF?startTime=1598983434000)

#### Reporting and Dashboards
Alyce defines influence as engagement, which would be any opportunity/pipeline with an Alyce gift that passed through viewed and/or accepted. We have integrated the Alyce dashboard into SFDC for easy access [HERE](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z4M000000oYBs). There is also a report folder for Alyce, which can be [found here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O/o?listview_pageState=1&sort=&fcf=00l4M000001ADlO&folderType=r&sfk=&entityType=&scope=noFilter&search=).

#### ROI & Metrics
- Total number of engagements
- Total number of meetings
- Total number of SAOs
- Pipeline progression
- 90 or 180-day progression

#### Personas
Our focus will be geared towards key-decision makers or fellow team members who can help push to key decision makers. This opens up our outreach to anyone in DevOps, DevSecOps, IT, and other related fields with titles ranging from Developer Team Lead to Executives.

Building rapport with a personalized experience that’s relatable, relevant, and respectful will be our cornerstone framework for any persona. Preferably, we’ll have had previous conversation before using Alyce.

#### Sales Acceleration
Every deal has multiple layers and multiple teams involved. This can lead to opportunities stalling unless you can re-engage and advance the conversation. Once a SAL has identified that they need to move the needle, our team will engage specifically with Alyce to move the conversation along.

If the SAL or the SDR has already started early stages discussion, a post-meeting follow-up will keep the relationship moving forward. By using information learned at their earlier communications they can send a personal thank you.

Once a target person has been identified within the Alyce system, the system needs 6-12 hours to come to you with suggested gifting options specific to that person.

#### Processing a New Alyce SOW and Campaign Setup

- If you are looking to run a new regional Alyce campaign and the team does not currently have a SOW in progress, you'll first need to contact the Alyce sales rep to discuss pricing/timeline/number of sends, review details with your regional manager, and have the sales rep create your SOW. Please contact `@krogel` for the Alyce sales rep contact details.
- NOTE: Gifting Costs - Your SOW will include an initial cost for gifting. You will need to budget additional gifting costs throughout the entirety of your contract timeframe. A helpful way to organize your budget is to have one line item for the initial cost of the tool/SOW and then a second line item for budgeting additional gifting costs to help track how much you are spending on gifting. Both line items should utilize the same campaign tag.
- Once you are ready to process your SOW, please follow the [Software Vendor/Product Approval Process](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#software-vendorproduct-approval-process).
- After you have a fully executed SOW, you will be introduced to our GitLab Alyce Customer Success Rep. They will walk you through the tool and explain how to set up your campaign in Alyce and adjust settings. They will also host training sessions for the sales reps and provide helpful documentation.
- When you are ready to set up your Alyce campaign in SFDC, your FMC will follow [these instructions](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#steps-to-setup-direct-mail-campaigns).
- For general details and questions, please see the [Alyce Help Center](https://help.alyce.com/hc/en-us) and these helpful [Alyce videos](https://www.alyce.com/page/2/?s&resource_type&persona_type=marketing&tag_type).
- We also currently have an Alyce Slack channel that includes our Customer Success Rep so they can answer any questions the team might have during the campaign. Please add your participating sales team to `#alycecollaboration`.

### SimplyDirect

#### Overview
SimplyDirect is a third party company that helps companies identify buyers and early adopters using the latest in big data tools and high-response surveys. The program from SimplyDirect includes surveying (through GatePoint Research), responder intelligence, and custom content creation in the shape of a Pulse Report highlighting the overall findings from survey responses.  These custom built surveys are developed via collaboration with GitLab sellers, Product Marketing, and Sales Development Reps, where the aim is to target accounts to create actionable sales intelligence which reveals an account’s needs, pain, plans and trends. In addition, GatePoint Research provides an incentive of a free gift upon completing the survey.

Our strategy is to leverage the data from the survey responses as well as the Pulse Report provided to set meetings and create sales-accepted opportunities. The data gathered from the surveys will also help the Digital Marketing Team and Campaign Managers by providing insight into the respondents current state of DevOps use and strategy as well as pain points and challenges.

#### Regions that Utilize Simply Direct
At this time, SimplyDirect is only used by our AMER Field Marketing team.

#### Successful Usage
Strategic success is contingent upon close alignment and communication between Marketing and Sales. Marketing will work collaboratively with Sales, Product Marketing and Campaign Managers to develop the survey. Best practice for the survey is 10 questions max. SDR’s will create a follow-up Outreach sequence to leverage when reaching out to those who’ve completed the survey.

Once the survey is complete, SDR’s will leverage the individual results and work with their SAL to:
- Identify points of interest in the survey pertaining to each individual response (i.e. pain points, number of tools, etc)
- Create a strategy based on matching those issues with GitLab offerings
- Customize their outreach communications to initiate conversations towards setting a IQM

#### Personas
Our focus will be geared towards key-decision makers or fellow team members who can help push to key decision makers. This opens up our outreach to anyone in DevOps, DevSecOps, IT and other related fields with titles ranging from Developer Team Lead to Executives.

Examples of personas/titles include: Director/VP of Engineering, Director / VP of Machine Learning (or AI), Director/VP of Enterprise Architecture, Director/VP of Product Development/Engineering, VP of Digital Transformation, Director of Applications, Director of Security (Information Security, IT Security, Application Security), VP of Operations.

#### Phases for SimplyDirect
- **Phase 1:** Sales and Marketing create the survey and share the target accounts and personas with SimplyDirect. Upon completion, SimplyDirect sends out the survey and shares survey results with the GitLab team via the SimplyDirect portal. The account list shared with SimplyDirect has an SDR assigned to each account so the tool will send the assigned SDR an email notifying them when a survey is completed. FMM will share the portal website, username, and password in the issue for SDRs or SALs to access survey results and analytics. FMM will also provide SDRs with training before launch on how to navigate the portal and share SimplyDirect's best practices. This phase is considered complete once the predetermined number of survey responses is achieved (number of responses will be identified in the SOW). Please note that a gift is sent to survey respondents by SimplyDirect as a thank you for completing the survey (Example: Columbia Jacket/Fleece). SimplyDirect also creates a detailed Pulse Report with survey results when the phase is completed and provides it to GitLab along with a list of high-intent targets who did not complete the survey (see Phase 3 details on how to utilize these additional targets). Access to the portal is not indefinite so a report should be pulled from the SimplyDirect portal in order to add survey responses to our own tracking sheet if needed.
- **Phase 2:** Leads are uploaded to SFDC automatically through our SimplyDirect<>Marketo integration and SDRs can set up an Outreach sequence to follow-up with these leads by sharing the Pulse Report. There is also an option of a swag giveaway at this phase if a meeting is booked/attended.
- **Phase 3:** SimplyDirect gathers a list of additional high-intent targets (also contracted in the SOW) that have not opted in to be contacted by GitLab directly. In order to try to capture these additional leads, we can create a Pathfactory track that requires visitors to enter in their contact information to view the track (which includes the Pulse Report and other assets). SimplyDirect includes this Pathfactory link in their follow-up email to the additional contacts. Anyone who enters their contact information in Pathfactory can be sent a follow-up by GitLab or can be added to nurture.

#### Reporting and Dashboards
SimplyDirect defines engagement by targets filling out the survey.  The SimplyDirect<>Marketo integration adds anyone who fills out the survey automatically into the salesforce campaign.

#### ROI & Metrics
- Total number of meetings
- Total number of SAOs
- Pipeline progression

### Printfection Direct Mail Giveaways

The below steps can be followed to set up and run a giveaway campaign using Printfection for field marketing. If you come across any steps that you can’t follow in Printfection, post in the [#swag Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C66R8N98F) so a Community Advocate can update your permissions levels.

1. Register and send the items you will be using to Printfection by following [these steps](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#send-items-to-printfection-warehouse)
1. Bundle your items together by creating a [Giveaway Kit](https://help.printfection.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006335613-How-to-start-a-new-kit) in Printfection
    - The picture of the Giveaway Kit is what the customer will see. If you’d like a different image to show than what Printfection puts together as a preview, be sure to provide this to the support team
    - Select Standard packaging or choose to create a custom box (a new custom box will incur additional expenses). If you’d like to use already created custom packaging (such as the GitLab branded Poly Mailers), check with the advocates in the #swag slack channel to make sure it’s okay for you to use
1. Set up a [Giveaway Campaign](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#create-a-new-giveaway-campaign)
    - [Add the kit](https://help.printfection.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026589734-Using-kits-in-Giveaway-campaigns) you created as an item in the Giveaway Campaign
    - The name of the giveaway campaign will be visible to the customer
    - Change from Paused to Running when you’re ready to run the campaign
1. Add a Printfection code column to your event spreadsheet with your leads. Copy over unique codes (generated above in the Printfection Giveaway Campaign) to assign a code to each lead
1. Work with your MPM to set up the Printfection URL & unique codes in your email copy (if desired, steps 5-7 are only relevant if sending a Marketo email rather than individually distributing the redemption links):
    - Place the Giveaway Campaign URL in your email copy (found on the Overview tab of the campaign in Printfection)
    - A custom Marketo field will be used to append the unique Printfection codes to the URL for each lead (example of how it works [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/1195#note_325404319)) and to place the code under the URL
1. Complete list upload prior to the email send date (example list upload [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/2343))
1. Work with your MPM to determine post redemption email needs. The options are follow up email and an automated confirmation email. The confirmation email triggers upon redemption of codes, the follow up email is sent at one time to a group of recipients. If an automated confirmation email is needed, define what status in SFDC should trigger the follow up email
using the Direct Mail campaign status progressions. (for example, when a person's campaign status changes to `Queued` it could trigger a confirmation email and when the status changes to `Shipped` the SDRs will begin follow up sequence (example [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/1195#follow-up-planned-from-field-marketing-fmc))
1. Once all above steps are complete, the Giveaway Campaign is ready to run. Make sure the Giveaway is changed from Paused to Running if you did not do this already in Step 3
1. When the campaign is running, monitor Redemptions, Shipping, and Costs under the Giveaway Campaign Overview in Printfection
    - Update redemptions/shipments in event spreadsheet if needed to notify SDRs (add additional columns to track)
    - Update SFDC status for leads once they redeem a code or item is shipped, depending on what was decided in Step 7
1. When a campaign is over and you no longer need the items in Printfection, follow [these steps](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#removing-products-from-printfection) to remove items from Printfection. If inventory is not yet 0, you will need to ship the items back to yourself/desired recipient before archiving. Until this is done, $25/month will still be charged per item. If relevant, the MPM must be instructed as to when the printfection codes are no longer needed on person records. This will signal that the MPM can now run a batch smart campaign to remove the printfection codes from the person records, thus freeing up the custom field for use in the future.

**Fees Involved:**

- Cost of the items you are using in the giveaway
- Fulfillment and shipping fees for each order placed once the giveaway is running (there is a Cost Estimate under campaign settings but please note actuals have ended up higher than their estimate so far) These will be on a Printfection invoice, more details to come on the invoice process.
- $25/month per item stocked in Printfection. This will not hit your field marketing campaign tag, but is an overall cost to GitLab to consider and be mindful of (noted in Step 12 [here](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#creating-the-send-order)

### EMEA Giveaway/SWAG Campaigns

- When printfection is not an option, EMEA Field Marketing utilise the services of vendor [Ten&One](https://www.tenandone.com/) to source, fulfill and ship giveaways/swag [EMEA SWAG](/handbook/marketing/events/#emea-field-marketing-swag). Please create an issue utilizing the [EMEA Swag Request Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/EMEA_SWAG_Request_template.md) or contact the EMEA FMC for further information and options.

### Lieferando (Takeaway Pay)

#### Overview
**Lieferando or Takeaway** is a leading online food delivery marketplace in Europe, focused on connecting consumers and restaurants through its platform. Takeaway offers an online marketplace where supply and demand for food delivery and ordering meet.

In EMEA we organise **Lunch & Learn** virtual sessions in collaboration with our SDR and SAL colleagues. These are virtual client/prospect meetings, normally reserved for those accounts which fall into our [large segment](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/), where we invite a company to participate in a presentation. We provide the RSVP'd attendees with lunch e-vouchers so they can order food directly to their office/home. We have a Lieferando/Takeaway Pay B2B account (monthly invoicing) in place that can be utilised for these Lunch & Learn virtual events.

#### Regions that use Lieferando/Takeaway
Takeaway Pay (their booking platform for B2B) currently operates in the following countries (note only € currency is available at this moment):
**Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Poland and Romania**

#### How it works - to order vouchers
Please contact @helenadixon on slack for assistanve with ordering the vouchers.
1. Log into our account Lieferando.de portal (please contact the EMEA Field Marketing team for login details)
2. Order the e-vouchers and send by email.

#### How it works - for the receiver
1. The receiver will receive an email with "GitLab GmbH has granted you a Takeaway Pay allowance."
2. There will be a button with "Takeaway Pay: Activate your Account". Please click on the blue button "Activate".
2. Now click on "Create new account" for creating a new Lieferando account.
3. Please create a new password.
4. Done! You can now browse restaurants, choose your favourite meal and pay with your Takeaway Pay budget.
5. The allowance allocated by GitLab is valid for a certain day/time/amount. This should be explained by email by the sender.

### Linkedin events Feature - FMM team access

#### About
The Field marketing team can use the GitLab Brand LinkedIn channel to create events. The LinkedIn Events feature provides members with an easy way to create and join professional Events that interest them, such as meetups, online workshops, seminars, and more.

#### Successful usage
##### [Click to view the field marketing Linkedin admin for events quick training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVxdjeRkps)
- The Field Marekting LinkedIn events admin can create, edit and maintain the events listings on the GitLab LinkedIn page. Please message the field marketing team in the #fieldmarketing Slack channel to request the admin to create an event.
###### Field Marketing admins who will respond to your request: 
* Kira Aubrey - AMER 
* Helena Dixon - EMEA 
- Information to be included on event pages: Title of event, date, time, region,registration link and About or description. 
- Field marketing are not authorized to write posts, edit the page or its contents, or to respond to users via the corporate LinkedIn account.
- LinkedIn events should only be used for events and not for campaigns.

Find out more on the social media page[here](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/social-marketing/admin/#field-marketing-team-access-to-linkedin-events-feature)

### Best Practices 
- The LinkedIn Event CTA button ATTEND is not synced to the registration link on our marketo registration page. The admin should include additional instructions in the About section of the LinkedIn event, for example: Please use the registration link to enter your details to register for this event.
- Add the LinkedIn events links into the SDR Request issue. A suggestion would be for the SDR team to check the LinkedIn events attendee list one week before each event to see who has clicked "ATTEND" on LinkedIn and compare the list with our registration list in SFDC. Then reach out to those who didn't register with a personalised LinkedIn inmail to invite them to register.

## Digital Tactics

- To run plays where we are targeting a specific geography or where we would like to propose content syndication, we work through our Digital Marketing Programs team. Please create an issue utilizing DMPs [Paid Digital Request Issue Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/new?issuable_template=paid-digital-request) if you'd like them to do work for you.
- To run plays where we are targeting a specific list of accounts, we work with our ABM team utilizing [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/account-based-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Demandbase_Campaign_Request_Template.md).

### Working with PMG

- For [paid social campaigns](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/digital-marketing/digital-marketing-management/#paid-social), where the FMM will use PMG (our ad agency) to promote a campaign, global Revenue Marketing is limited to launching 3 new campaigns/month.  To identify and prioritize the campaigns asks globally, field marketing follows the process for [global revenue marketing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/#revenue-marketing-collaboration).

### Tracking success of digital tactics 
Please ensure you are using our UTM tracker (look up `Google Analytics Campaign Tagging Tool - UTM generator for tracking` in the Gdrive to find doc). In order to identify which campaigns are from the Field Marketing team, you must add the letters fmm at the end of your campaign name in column E. All lowercase with no spaces or special characters. This allows us to pull ROI reporting, so please don't leave these letters out or else you will lose reporting from a dashboard standpoint. 

## Account-Centric Micro-Campaign

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Expand below to see details regarding Account-Centric Micro-Campaigns</summary>


The purpose of the regional integrated micro-campaign is to build and drive a specific strategy in a region (with a specific list of targeted accounts/look-a-like accounts). This could be based on intent data pulled from our ABM tool, DemandBase, or it could be based on accounts you’ve agreed to target with your SAL. A micro-campaign must include a minimum of 2 different account-centric tactics.

**For example:**

- If you are planning a virtual Lunch & Learn and want to utilize LinkedIn InMail as well, those 2 account-centric tactics together make up a micro-campaign. However, if you are planning a Lunch & Learn on its own without any additional tactics, that is just considered an [Individual Tactic](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#individual-tactics).

### What does Account-Centric mean?

At times, Field Marketing will run an account-centric approach to its in-region campaigns. Account-Centric is an approach where both sales and marketing are focusing their efforts on a very specific list of targeted accounts in order to increase engagement and ultimately pipeline creation within this list of accounts. The SAL/FMM/SDR are responsible for outlining which accounts are account-centric and accounts can easily pop in and out of being in the account-centric play based on the strategy that’s being executed.
i.e. If a FMM is targeting to get 15 people into an interactive roundtable discussion, that will greatly impact the number of accounts that are targeted for that specific tactic vs if they were trying to 100+ people into that same discussion.

### How to track the ROI of your Account-Centric approach

In order to track engagement, you need to start with a baseline and over time, track the progress on how engaged that account is with us. Right now this is a manual process where this [SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004e4Ll) should be modified by pulling in all the accounts that are in the account-centric GTM Strategy per rep and then you must take a snap shot in time (SFDC does not allow for historical data pulls) by exporting the data and saving to a gsheet. [Example of gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m7xxoKcXW3Lq8eXIPg5KIOMGXIItp7MEZeBXAFfszOI/edit#gid=206509375&range=A1). Depending on your campaign, you can export this data on a weekly or monthly cadence to monitor progress.

In order to change the GTM Strategy field for accounts in SFDC from `Volume` to `Account-Centric`, you can employ two options: a) Change the GTM Strategy field for each account manually if you have <20 accounts in the campaign, or b) Create a MOps request to have all accounts changed from `Volume` to `Account-Centric` in bulk. To request the bulk adjustment, please utilize [this MOps template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=abm_bulk_update_request).

Account-Centric is different from Account Based Marketing in the sense that ABM focuses on accounts as markets of one versus account-centric targeting a group of accounts. At GitLab we run a 3-Tiered approach to ABM focused around our ICP and target 100-150 accounts in our ABM strategy at any given time. For complete details on how GitLab runs its Account Based Marketing, please head to the [GitLab ABM page](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/account-based-strategy/account-based-marketing/#what-is-account-based-marketing).

At GitLab, we utilize Bizible for attribution tracking. In order to track the touchpoints of your campaign, modify [this linear IACV SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aDSN) . This report shows Opportunity: Incremental ACV and Linear iACV.

- If your campaign has a SFDC campaign with leads associated to it, then you will pull in the SFDC Field `Salesforce Campaign` equals .
- If your campaign does NOT have a SFDC Campaign with leads associated OR you also are wanting to track the opportunities from your digital spend, then you would add in the SFDC `Ad Campaign Name` equals . We use the same UTM per channel, so all channels (paid ads, LinkedIn Mail, DemandBase, etc.) will pull all influenced iacv. Stay tuned for more details on Bizible.

### Account-Centric Micro-Campaign Team

- Field Marketing Manager - overarching DRI responsible for opening [the micro-campaign issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Micro_Campaign_and_Individual_Tactics), reviewing the intent data from the ABM DRI, and building the strategy based on what the intent data is suggesting (i.e. are a lot of folks searching to Kubernetes? Is it digital transformation? What call to action do we have? Do you want a direct mail piece involved? Do you want to drive to an On-Demand or scheduled webcast?), owning, and driving the mico-campaign, including epic and issue creation and communicating timelines and actions needed of other team members with relevant SLAs from request to delivery.
- Account Based Marketing (ABM) Manager - will work with FMM to produce target account list based on intent data and known targets & will also lead strategy session with Demandbase Campaign Manager, should the FMM decided its part of the strategy to deploy ads via Demandbase.
- Sales Development Rep (SDR) - Will assist in building out the actual target people & build Outreach cadence to support agreed upon CTA.
- Digital Marketing Programs - Can assist in deploying paid digital strategies (ex: display ads, paid search, paid social, and/or paid publisher placement) and geo focused ads via our digital agency. They can also help get our digital agency involved should the FMM want to engage with the agency.
- Marketing Program Managers - Setup of Marketo and Salesforce campaigns with correct program type to support the tactic. Guidance on system tracking, setup of Marketo email follow up, and addition of needs to existing email nurture programs (all as needed). Facilitate new program types with MOps and other MPMs as necessary.

### Steps for the Creation and Organization of Micro-Campaign Epics & Issues

#### 1. FMM opens overarching issue

<i>FMM opens a field marketing issue using the [Micro-Campaign and Individual Tactics Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Micro_Campaign_and_Individual_Tactics)</i>, listing the tactics to be used from the list below in step 2. At this point, the issue is in `PLAN` stage.

**WHY? The purpose of opening the overarching micro-campaign issue is to discuss the plan with any teams that would require work and gain agreement on SLAs before opening epics and issues.** _Remember - as of today, epics cannot be made confidential, they cannot show up on issue boards, and there is no such thing as an epic template._

**Here is what needs to be included before moving from `PLAN` to `WIP`:**

- Agreement on SLAs and scope between other teams involved in selected tactics - [SLA workback doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280)
- Formulation of a clear strategy and understanding of customer journey
- Completion of all fields in the `Details` section of the micro-campaign template

_For anything that’s listed in the `Tactics included` section of the template the FMM needs to be clear about their specific ask & what the desired outcome will be. If the FMM does not know, it's ok to set up a call to talk through ideas and strategies._

#### 2. FMM opens specific tactic issues

_FMM opens additional issues relevant to their micro-campaign, if required._

**WHY? The purpose of opening the issue is so that each individual tactic shows up on the FMM boards.** _Remember - as of today, Epics cannot be made confidential, they cannot show up on issue boards, and there is no such thing as an epic template._

**Issue Templates for Each Tactic:**
Please see the Field Marketing Issue Templates and Epic Codes list [**HERE**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) for a comprehensive list of templates to be utilized for each tactic.

#### 3. FMM creates tactic epics

_FMM follows the instructions for epic creation based on the tactics decided._

**WHY? The purpose of opening the epics and issues is to organize the campaign in GitLab with the epic being equivalent to the project/campaign and issues being equivalent to the tactical execution steps to complete the campaign.**

**How to create the epic:**

- Where to create the epic: [Marketing Epic Repo](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics?sort=created_desc)
- How to create the epic: Click "New Epic" at the top right of the screen
- What to name the epic: The naming convention is listed in the epic code for each specific tactic.
- What to choose as the due date: this should be the same as your micro-campaign issue due date. For example - If your micro-campaign involves 3 different tactics and the last tactic is set to close out on December 5, 2020, that should be your due date.
- How to link the epic to the issue: In your epic click on Epics + Issues - Add - Add an existing issue - Link your issue

**Micro-Campaign Epic Code**
This epic will include the general details of your micro-campaign.

```
<--- Name this epic using the following format, then delete this line: [Micro-Campaign Tactic Name] - [3-letter Month] [Date], [Year] --->

## [Micro-Campaign Issue >>]()

## :notepad_spiral: Details
(copy and pasted from your micro-campaign issue)

/label ~"mktg-status::wip" ~"Field Marketing" ~"FMM-MicroCampaign" ~"FMM-Other Tactics"
```
**Epic Codes for Each Tactic:**
Please see the Field Marketing Issue Templates and Epic Codes list [**HERE**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) for a comprehensive list of epic codes to be utilized for each tactic.

#### 4. FMM creates relevant issues and assigns DRIs and due dates

_At this point the FMM has the main issue (for agreement by teams), the tactic issue(s) (to show up on boards), and the tactic epics (to capture overarching tactic plan and organize issues). Now FMMs will create the issues to request the work and timeline of teams involved in each tactic._

In each epic code (from step 3), there are issue template links included that indicate what issues need to be created (example - follow up email, facilitate tracking, etc.) - if they do not say "optional" then they are required. The FMM will create each issue and link to the epic so that all tactical issues are organized together clearly in GitLab.

The FMM will designate DRI as indicated and set due dates based on [SLAs](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/#timeline-guidelines) for each item that is being requested. [SLA workback sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280) is available to help you.

**Note: This is essentially creating the work-back execution plan using issues, DRIs, and due dates.**
If the date of the tactic is changed, the FMM is responsible for updating the due dates of all issues accordingly. It is also important to remember that the DRIs on the issues are not notified when due dates are added. If you create an issue and then add due dates at a later time (or change due dates), please remember to ping the DRIs in the issue so they are aware dates have been added or changed.

#### 5. Organizing Epics

Your micro-campaign issue and epic is an overview of your micro-campaign strategy and each individual tactic supporting the micro-campaign requires its own issue and epic. When you add individual tactic epics to the micro-campaign epic, the micro-campaign epic automatically becomes the [Parent Epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#relationships-between-epics-and-issues). Each individual tactic epic, when nested under the micro-campaign epic, automatically becomes the [Child Epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#relationships-between-epics-and-issues). Whichever epic you nest the other epics under will automatically become the Parent Epic, so remember to always add your individual tactic epics to the micro-campaign epic and not the other way around.

For example - You have created a micro-campaign that will include a self-service event with promotion, a survey, LinkedIn InMail, and DemandBase targeted ads.

- You will create an epic for your micro-campaign per the [above instructions](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#3-fmm-creates-tactic-epics).
- Your self-service event with promotion will require a separate issue with its own epic.
- Your survey will also require a separate issue with its own epic.
- Your LinkedIn InMail will require its own issue (the only DMP tactic that currently requires an epic is Content Syndication).
- Your DemandBase ads will require its own issue (ABM tactics do not currently require epics).

**To organize your various tactic epics under your micro-campaign epic:**

- Click into your micro-campaign epic
- Scroll down to Epics & Issues
- Click Add an Epic
- Paste the epics from your other tactics into this section and GitLab will automatically organize the tactic epics under your micro-campaign epic

### FAQ's - Micro Campaigns and Other Tactics

1. If I am only running 1 tactic, do I need to create the micro campaign issue? Answer: No, you do not. A microcampaign includes at least [2 account centric tactics](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#account-centric-micro-campaign).
1. If I want to run ads through our ABM vendor do I need to create a micro campaign issue? Answer: No, you do not. A microcampaign includes at least [2 account centric tactics](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#account-centric-micro-campaign). Ads with our ABM vendor is only 1 tactic.

### Reminders - Micro Campaigns and Other Tactics

1. **Labels** - be aware of your labels. Please be mindful that you're adding the correct labels.
1. Epic label issue - There is a glitch right now which may keep the labels from auto-assigning. In order to have the labels added to your epic, you'll need to copy the /label line from the epic code into a comment to pull over all labels. [Quick video how-to](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gK8G4CBaqcgWgB6b2A1BRSQCma5GfJyt). 2 mins
1. If you create an epic & sub issues and DO NOT have a date, then when you go back and add dates then you MUST ping the assigners - could be FMC, MPM, OPS, etc.
1. When you go from plan to WIP that's when everything starts - from the SLA workback as well.
1. The details section is so important - what that tells the MPM/FMC how this program should flow. You can't move your issue to the WIP stage until the details are added - This is where if attention to detail isn’t your BFF, you need to make it your BFF. ;)

## Individual Tactics

Remember, an account-centric micro-campaign consists of at least 2 different account-centric tactics. If you are planning an individual tactic (account-centric or not), follow the below steps. Refer to the information provided in [Steps for the Creation and Organization of Micro-Campaign Epics & Issues](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#steps-for-the-creation-and-organization-of-micro-campaign-epics--issues), for _how_ to create the issues & epics if needed.

1. Open tactic issue (see [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) for issue links)
1. Open tactic epic (see [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) for epic code)
1. Create relevant sub-issues (from links in the epic), assign DRIs and due dates

Reminder for what needs to be included before moving from PLAN to WIP:

- Agreement on SLAs and scope between other teams involved in selected tactics - [SLA workback doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280)
- Completion of all fields in the `Event Details` and `FMC Checklist` sections of the issue, as well as completed line item in Allocadia

# Suggested workflow to ensure your campaigns are accurate

After Field Marketing has run a campaign, the Field Marketing Manager is responsible for ensuring that the campaign has operationally fully run to include the following:

- The campaign DRI reviews and cleans up list following the guidelines for [list imports](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/)
- SDRs should not be asked to follow up leads before they are added to Salesforce
- If a follow-up email was to go out to all attendees and no-shows, the FMM is responsible for ensuring that emails were sent.
- Did the campaign respondents receive the correct amount of MQL points they should have received for the activity the took?
    - Person score is available to be viewed in our `Custom Links` section of each SFDC campaign. This allows you to view the MQL score of the campaign members, whether they be a lead or contact, all within one view.
- Did a lead/contact hit our MQL threshold and have the SDRs followed up with this record and moved them beyond the [MQL stage](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#mql-scoring-model)?
- Update all the relevant tabs in the field marketing campaign event planning sheet.

# ROI tracking for Field Marketing

For a complete picture of GitLab Marketing Metrics, please refer to our [Marketing Metrics page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketing-metrics/).

This section will go into specifics on the workflow for a Field Marketer to check their results.

At the highest level, Field Marketing is responsible for helping to create [Sales Accepted Opportunities](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/sales-sdr-alignment/#criteria-for-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao) with the Sales Development team.  We also track campaign contribution to the sales pipeline as well as velocity of the opportunities that interact with our campaigns.

In order to track engagement for any work we do with PMG (our global digital marketing partner), a campaign UTM code will be created by the DMP team. The DMP team uses this UTM code to create a SFDC UTM Report. Please note a SFDC UTM Report is not the same as a SFDC Campaign (which pulls in registrations for events, webinars and content syndication leads). It is a dedicated report for our paid digital efforts only. For more information on UTM's at GitLab [can be found here](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/digital-marketing-management/#utms-for-url-tagging-and-tracking).

You will follow this process when you are working with our 3rd party digital agency to serve your target audience ads/LinkedIn InMails.

At the highest level, it's interesting to see the spend, clicks, impressions, CPC (cost per click), inquiries, and CPI (cost per inquiry). This is done by going to the Field Marketing Specific digital spend Dashboard via PMG agency, linked in the `Useful Links` section and searching for your campaign using the campaigns UTM code. Here is the report as well, because we know sometimes you just want the link in the exact place you are looking for it in ;) . [WW SFDC Field Marketing Digital Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aA0V)

Inquiries (people who end up registering for your event or engaging with your ad) are the most important to look into and really the status of them attending your event or interacting with your campaign, eventually leading to an SAO and then pipeline!

If you were driving people to register for something, then hop over to your SFDC campaign. Then go down to the `Custom Links` section and click on the `View All Campaign Members` report.

You’ll then want to sort by `Ad Campaign Name (FT)`, which answers the question “What was the 1st touch ad this record interacted with?” and also the `Ad Campaign Name (LC)`, which answers the question “What ad created this lead?”.

If you did not have a specific SFDC Campaign you were driving to, and you wanted to see the success of your campaign, then you would still refer to the [WW SFDC Field Marketing Digital Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aA0V), add in your campaigns UTM there, using the filter `Ad Campaign Name` [contains] and add your UTM.

Please note that whilst you can track leads via SFDC campaigns or UTM reports, pipeline generated should be viewed on [Sisense](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/556414/Marketing-Linear-Attribution) only, as SFDCs last touch model is different from our multi touch attribution model.

#### How to trouble shoot your ROI questions
If you have a quick 1 off question on reporting, then please feel free to ask the question in the #fieldmarketing slack channel.

If you have several questions or a more robust analysis of data you'd like help with, please open a [FMM leadership request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leadership_request) and assign it to your manager. Your manager will review and will pull in the Director or other folks as needed.

#### Field Marketers within SFDC
To help with reporting within SFDC, each Field Marketing Manager is assigned the accounts based on SAL/AE assignment. Field Marketing has decided to align with the SAL/AE vs. 100% geo focused in an effort to foster collaboration.  The assignments are done through [Lean Data](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/leandata/), which is our lead routing tool.

Routing for geo reps is done through zip codes worldwide. Named accounts and the US Public Sector are manually handled differently. Sales Ops will run monthly audits to update PubSec and Named accounts. Field Marketing Management works with Sales Ops to keep this information up to date.

Should you come across an account you believe should be owned (or perhaps NOT owned by you) please follow these steps:
1. Within the account in SFDC, please chatter @sales-support and provide reason why this account should be updated
1. If more than 10 accounts need updated or if a FMM changes regions, then please open a [sales ops issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20Request) requesting the update be made.

Complete details on how GitLab Sales handles rules of Account Engagement can be [found here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/).

#### PathFactory

Via our Marketing Operations team, Field Marketers can request Author Role access to PathFactory to upload and curate assets into tracks that are then disseminated for use in Marketo, about.gitlab.com, and other campaign-related channels. Field Marketing currently has Reporter level access. To view the difference in user roles, head over to the [PathFactory page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#access).

### The Benefits of having Author Role Access
1. Efficiency gains: It takes more time to create a request issue for the Campaigns Team and wait for the request to be processed than it takes to upload an asset or create the track yourself.
1. Ownership: Having author role access to PathFactory will allow Field Marketing to have control on asset uploads and content tracks to ultimately personalise the PathFactory experience according to region, country and target accounts.
1. Optimisation: Viewing each asset/track's performance can help Field Marketing refine and optimise the content with monthly or quarterly refreshes.

### Getting Started
Visit the [User Role](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#user-roles) section of the PathFactory page to learn more about the Author Role: [the Getting started video series](http://successwith.pathfactory.com/c/lookbookhq-tutorial-?x=Blrk3E) and [Author role training (Do not share externally - PII data presented](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YdK96hzDj043iESfDXV7ejz5sgbIXKCv/view?usp=sharing) are mandatory trainings to complete prior to submitting an AR to MOps.

This section will continue to be fleshed out as we rollout to the global Field Marketing team.

# Process for Issues Moving from Plan to WIP

The following is the process for when a Field Marketing issue moves from `mktg-status::plan` to `mktg-status::wip`.

- FMM pings the FMC in the main Field Marketing issue and requests the FMC move the issue to WIP and keeps issue label `mktg-status::plan`. **Reminder:** Event Details and FMC Checklist must be filled out in full and line item complete in Allocadia to request moving an issue to WIP.
- FMC confirms the campaign tag or Allocadia ID has been created
- FMC creates the epic and sub-issues utilizing [this list of epics](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status)
- FMC adds the event to the appropriate events calendar. All events should be added to the internal calendar.
- FMC adds the event to the [GitLab Events Page](/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents), if applicable (specified by the FMM in the FMC Checklist section of the issue) 
- FMC creates the [Marketo program and SFDC campaign](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#campaign-type--progression-status) utilizing the Facilitate Tracking sub-issue previously created
   - FMC pings the FMM in the Facilitate Tracking issue that the Marketo program and SFDC campaign have been created and closes issue
- When all the above tasks have been completed, the FMC will ping the FMM in the Field Marketing issue to confirm completion of the above tasks and will move the issue label `mktg-status::plan` to `mktg-status::wip`.

# Rescheduling or Cancelling Events

## [Marketing Calendar](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#marketing-calendar)

When an event is rescheduled or cancelled, the FMC is responsible for updating the [Marketing Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2V3Aj1l_UT5hEb54nczzinGUxtxswZBhZV8r9eErqM/edit#gid=571560493).
- For a reschedued event, the FMC will update the start and end dates in columns A & B.
- For a cancelled event, the FMC will select the event line item and add a strikethrough to indicate the event has been cancelled.

## Rescheduling or Cancelling a Self-Service Event

Please see process here. - `Will be added soon, waiting on another MR to merge.`

## Rescheduling or Cancelling a Webast or Workshop

Please see process [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#rescheduling-a-webcast) for rescheduling and [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#cancelling-a-webcast) for cancelling.

## Rescheduling or Cancelling a Sponsored Virtual Event

Please see process [here](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/external-virtual-events/#rescheduling-external-virtual-events) for rescheduling and [here](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/external-virtual-events/#cancelling-external-virtual-events) for cancelling.

# Process to Close Marketo Landing Pages and Landing Page Forms

The FMC will track all open Marketo LPs and will be responsible for requesting the LP be closed once the event occurs. 
- The FMC will re-open the Marketo LP issue and request Verticurl follow one of the below processes (depending on campaign type, as Marketo program templates vary across different tactics). 
- The FMC will specify if the page should be shut down completely or if the request is to close the LP form (to no longer allow registrations) and to update the verbiage at the top of the page (i.e. to specify if the event has occurred, is at capacity, etc.). 
- The FMC will update the due date of the issue and move the triage label back to `FMM-Verticurl::WIP`.

## Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP after the event has occurred
*The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Verticurl when closing a Marketo LP form after an event has occurred.*  

Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. This event has concluded and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our [events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) for more information on upcoming events and dates.  

## Closing a Marketo LP 
*These instructions are standard across all campaign types and will close down the entire LP and re-routes visitors to our about.gitlab.com page.*

- Sign into Marketo
- Click into the Marketo program for the landing page you wish to close
- Click into `Assets`
- Click `Registration Landing Page`
- At the top of the page click `Landing Page Actions`
- In the drop down list click `Unapprove` 
- Click the orange `Unapprove` button in the pop up box
- Go to your landing page URL and make sure the landing page is no longer active (the site that should pop up is `about.gitlab.com`)

## Closing a Marketo LP Form
These instructions explain how to close a Marketo LP form and how to update the LPs verbiage at the top of the page. The page and the information on it will still be visible to visitors, but there will no longer be a form to fill out for registration.

# Owned Tactics that Involve Collecting Addresses
There are times that Field Marketing will run campaigns that involve building a landing page in Marketo in order to collect addresses for shipping swag. Examples of these instances are a 5k run, GitLab-hosted tasting event, direct mail campaigns, etc. When collecting addresses, please follow the below instructions for ensuring PII compliancy.

## Landing Page Verbiage
When collecting addresses on our Marketo landing pages, make sure to always include the following verbiage on the page - `By giving us your address, you are giving us permission to mail items to your home or office. We will not use this data for any other purposes.`

## Pulling Addresses for Swag Sends
Please note that due to PII compliancy, addresses collected in Marketo landing pages are not synced to SFDC. As a result, Marketing Ops support is required to pull the address list from Marketo (Field Marketing does not have this level of access in Marketo). Once the report is downloaded, Marketing Ops will then also delete the PII information directly in Marketo. To request this support, please review [this page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#list-exports) and open an [export request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=export_request) to specify when a list pull and PII deletion is needed. Also remember to delete PII from any order spreadsheets once swag has shipped.

# Sourcing New Field Marketing Vendors

Field marketers are always looking for new ways to support the sales teams within their regions and to provide unique, alternative ways to draw potential prospects closer to our company and show value to our current customers in order to expand within those accounts. Field marketers have a vast tool kit of marketing initiatives for precisely that. However, sometimes a gap is identified and field marketers will look to external third party vendors to help fill that gap when it comes to achieving their goals to their marketing metrics.

When souring and selecting a new third-party vendor, there are a few things that should be considered:

1. What are you trying to achieve? What is the gap you have identified? Is it filling the top of the funnel? Building relationships within a specific target audience (i.e. C-Level)? Maybe your goal is delivering on more qualified leads? Be clear on your end goal(s) from the beginning.
1. Can this vendor achieve your goal? Have the vendor show you proven use cases and references on your specific goals.
1. Have you sourced more than 1 vendor? A good point of reference is to research at least 2 or 3.
1. Is this vendor willing to proceed with a pilot program with you? Even with the best intentions, not all 3rd party vendors will fulfill your needs as originally discussed. A pilot program will allow you to try out the vendor and/or their product without requiring a full investment up front.
1. Identify all of the pieces of the contract. Ensure that you and the 3rd party vendor are aligned on the following:
    - Cost
    - Timeline of project
    - Timeline of onboarding
    - What is required when it comes to integration - Full Access, No Access or Partial Access
    - What are your deliverables?
    - What are their deliverables?
    - Identify who needs to be trained. What does that training involve?
    - Who will be the DRI for the project (always have 1 person who will support you during your contract process)?
    - What is the cost of renewal, or, if you are running a pilot, what is the cost of a full term contract?
    - If you're running a pilot, what are the goals you have in place to determine if you should invest beyond the pilot phase?

Once you feel confident that you have chosen the right 3rd party vendor, now is the time to begin the following review process.

# Software Vendor/Product Approval Process

1. FMM and FMC to review the [Procurement Handbook Page](/handbook/finance/procurement/#when-should-i-contact-procurement) so you are familiar with the procurement process and lead times. Allow [60-90 days](/handbook/finance/procurement/#when-should-i-contact-procurement) for processing all reviews, approvals and contract negotiations. Note that if the overall cost of the product is over $100k, 2-3 comparison bids are required.
1. FMM to open a [Field Marketing Issue](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) and detail out the justification for the potential new vendor/product. Include any presentations, slides and demos that have been provided to help explain the product. Tag your regional manager in the issue to review and discuss. Approval must be received to move forward. Make sure to attach all of the following issues to your main Field Marketing Issue for easy access.
1. FMM to open a [Contract Request](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-contract-requests) issue and assign to the regional FMC.
    - SLA for FMC to complete the Contract Request issue is 3 business days from the date all needed info is filled out by the FMM in the Contract Request issue. FMM to leave a note if turnaround is urgent (FMCs have been averaging 1-2 business days currently).
1. FMC to process an NDA with the vendor, specified in the [Prior to Contacting Procurement](/handbook/finance/procurement/prior-to-contacting-procurement/) instructions in the Handbook. This NDA will be required in your Software Vendor Contract Request Issue.
1. If you're requesting a new tool, FMM to open a [Marketing Ops Eval](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#requesting-a-new-tool) issue. Marketing Ops will help evaluate the product and will assist in the procurement process. They will also help you determine if an integration is required with any products in our current tech stack and if so, which team will be the DRI for the integration.
1. If you're requesting a new tool, FMC to open a [Software Vendor Contract Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=software_vendor_contract_request) and follow the instructions. Please note that you can open this issue even before a contract has been provided. This template details the following approvals:
    - NDA requirement
    - Privacy review (if applicable)
    - Security review
    - Tech stack request (for new software purchases)
1. If you're requesting a new tool, once the Software Vendor Contract Request has been approved by all teams and the contract has been fully executed, FMC to proceed with invoice processing.
1. If you're requesting a new tool, and if the new product requires integration with any of our existing products (SFDC, Marketo, Outreach, etc.) FMC to open an integration request issue with the appropriate team (see step above where the Marketing Ops team will help determine). Integration will not begin until all approvals are final and the contract has been fully executed, but opening the integration issue early will give the appropriate team advance notice for planning.

For contracts or invoices ready to submit for approval, the FMM will open an issue utilizing the [`Contract_Request`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/issues/new?issuable_template=Contract_Request) template and follow the instructions to provide important details required before assigning to the regional FMC. SLA for FMC to complete the Contract Request issue is 3 business days from the date all needed info is filled out by the FMM in the Contract Request issue. FMM to leave a note if turnaround is urgent (FMCs have been averaging 1-2 business days currently).

# Suggesting an Event or Tactic

If you are interested in requesting Field Marketing's support for a particular in-person or virtual event or tactic, please follow the process listed on our [Events Page](/handbook/marketing/events/#suggesting-an-event).

# [Field Marketing planning](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xtePKOl4RSINaPPr3InQNisYTQyOJ5JE)

It is our goal to have planning for each qtr completed four (4) weeks before the next quarter starts. At this time, we have the following time line set for regional plans:

- Q1 plan is due Jan 6
- Q2 plan is due April 1, and this is no [April Fools](https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/april-fools-day) joke! ;)
- Q3 plan is due July 1
- Q4 plan is due Oct 1

A standard deck will also be used to ensure consistency across the world in terms of how the plan is presented.

The SSOT of the plan remains in GitLab on our [various issue boards](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#whats-currently-scheduled-in-my-region).

- [FY22 Standard deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KNrUFwa7t2KKBRijamfuZvwaI4h3qVkXutUeEhR3qsI/edit#slide=id.g29a70c6c35_0_68).
    - Note: The deck is additive. You are only responsible for completing the slides that are due for the quarter we are in.
    - As the slides are due one (1) month before the end of the quarter, if you have a campaign/tactic that you want to highlight on the recap slide that has not been completed, please share this with your manager and propose a date when you will have that slide completed.
    - The completed deck should be stored in your correct regions [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xtePKOl4RSINaPPr3InQNisYTQyOJ5JE). Anyone within GitLab has access to search and find this folder.
    - Your regional budget document should also be updated and accurate this time to allow our finance colleagues the ability to load our quarterly plans into their forecasting tool so we can run the budget vs. actuals monthly meeting.

## Field Marketing QBRs
Shortly following the day that the regional plans are due, each region will hold its own QBR. The regional Manager of Field Marketing will be responsible for setting up this meeting and inviting the necessary team members. The point of the QBR is for the Field Marketing Manager to share their qtrly long plans with their SDR Manager colleagues, Field Marketing colleagues, and Field Marketing Leadership. This time together is meant to be informative and also educational to all who are attending.

For the EMEA region, the regional Field Marketing Managers are invited to the respective regional sales QBRs to present their quarterly plan and numbers. Following our efficiency value, the EMEA Field Marketing QBR will be set to the first week of the quarter start to allow to have a complete quarter to review and to avoid having to update the presentation again for the sales QBRs. This does not change the due dates for the quarterly plan as agreed in the [planning section](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-planning).

### FMM QBR attendees

## Next Steps after Quarterly  plans are complete 
In an effort to share the FMM team plans with the rest of the marketing team, the below steps will be followed. 

### Marketing Calendar 
Within two days of the FMM plan being [locked by Finance](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/Marketing-Finance/#important-dates) in Allocadia, the Director of Field Marketing will download the team's plans from Allocadia and will upload to the shared [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar). 

If any dates change after the upload has happened the FMC will make the date update within the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar). 

### Channel plans 
By the 15th of the 3rd month of the quarter, the Director of Field Marketing will open a FMM issue outlining the Field Marketing led Channel campigns for the upcoming quarter. This is done using the Partner Drill in Report - which is found in the Allocadia Insights --> 2. Pipeline --> Partners Drill in (4th Tab).  The Director of Channel Marketing will be tagged for an FYI. 

### Plans by GTM Motion 
By the 15th of the 3rd month of the quarter, the Director of Field Marketing will open a FMM issue outlining the Field Marketing campigns that align per GTM Motion for the upcoming quarter. This is done using the Partner Drill in Report - which is found in the Allocadia Insights --> 2. Pipeline --> Quarterly Drill in Details ALL (3rd Tab).  The issues will then be associated with each GTMs epic and the issues will be shared in the various GTM motion Slack channels. 

### Asks into Digital Campaigns 
Details on how Field Marketing shares quarterly plans with the Digital team can be [found here](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/#digital-campaigns). 

### Asks into Portfolio Marketing 
By the 15th of the 3rd month of the quarter, all asks for the Portfolio Marketing team for the upcoming quarter should be opened up for their review. Following their process outlined here. It's the responsibility of each FMM to ensure their asks are in by this time. The ~Field Marketing label must be added to the request in order for the PM team to review. We will use[this list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/strategic-marketing/product-marketing/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Field+Marketing&label_name%5B%5D=sm_request&scope=all&sort=due_date&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93) to review. 


# Field Marketing/Channel Marketing Engagement and GTM Strategy

GitLab launched its [channel sales program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/) in April 2020.

As part of that program, each Channel Account Manager (CAM) will have a maximum of 3-5 Select Channel partners for [P0 and P1 regions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/localization/#priority-countries). The complete list of Select Channel Partners are identified in SFDC [here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSq6). (*Please note, SFDC is the SSOT for our roster of Select Partners.)

GitLab will continuously iterate on Select Partners, so it is a best practice to check the [SFDC list](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSq6) frequently. Each regional Field Marketing Manager should work closely with their CAM to become familiar with the Select Partners within their respective regions and their core competencies.

In order for a GitLab Partner to reach Select status, the Select Partner must:
- Have a fully executed Partner contract in place
- Have been fully onboarded/enabled and certified for both sales and technical ability to adequately represent GitLab
- Have a working business plan (developed with the GitLab CAM) for the next 2 quarters (at minimum) that clearly outlines what and where the Select partner will be focusing in on (e.g., what kind of practices will they be standing up: DevOps, DevSecOps, GitOps, etc., market segment, vertical industry, geographic territory if applicable.)

## Field Marketing initiated and funded campaigns 

Jointly with their regionally algined CAM, Field Marketers have a specific budget amount (about 10% of their budget) set aside for joint GitLab/channel partner camapigns. The primary goal of this activity is to convert MQLs to SAOs. 

In order for FMM to engage in lead generation activity, the CAM needs to fill out the [Channel Lead Gen request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Channel_LeadGen_Req).

Once the lead gen request has been completed, the FMM is to collaborate with the CAM and build campaigns with channel to exhaust the budget allocation as well as reach the SAO goals as outlined in the FY22 Revene Marketin goal sheet, which is store in google drive and accessiable by all GitLab team members. 

Note: The Channel Partner Enablement team is the DRI to make sure each Select Partner is fully enabled prior to FMM engagement. FMMs should not be involved in any channel enablement. 

Select Partner marketing activities can be:
- Fully funded by FMM budget
- Funded jointly by FMM budget and Select Partner
- Funded jointly by FMM, GitLab MDF (see [MDF process](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/)) and Select Partner

### CAM/Partner Initiated (MDF Funded)

As outlined in the [Channel Handbook - [MDF section](/handbook/resellers/#the-market-development-funds-mdf-program)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/), GitLab Select partners have access to the proposal-based GitLab Marketing Development Funds (MDF) Program.

The DRI for budget tracking and ROI measurement will be the Channel Marketing team with Field Marketing being the DRI for the 3rd step in the approval of the MDF proposal within their respective region.

1. Step 1 in the approval process is the CAM approving the MDF request
1. Step 2 is the Channel Marketing team approving the request. The full approval process can be reviewed [here](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/).

FMMs may work with “Open” partners outside of P0 and P1 regions depending upon the strength of their MDF proposal AND their potential/desire to elevate to Select status. Those proposals will be considered on a case by case basis, and final approval lies with GitLab Channel Marketing, unless Field Marketing support is requested, in which case final approval lies with the regional FMM involved.

### Sample types of activities to engage with Select Partners

- Workshops
- Webcast / Lunch and Learn programs
- Account Acceleration Programs
- Direct Mail Programs
- Surveys

### Lead Management in the Channel

- GitLab will own the leads and lead management if the Channel Partner is participating in a GitLab led initiative (FMM led and funded). 
- The Channel Partner will own leads and lead management if the lead gen activity is a joint GTM push where both the partner and GitLab are both part of the solution (i.e. GitLab software + partner implementation services + partner integration services)
- The Channel Partner will own leads and lead management if GitLab is participating in a Channel Partner led initiative. (MDF Co-Funded)
- Both GitLab and the Channel partner will work the leads and lead management if GitLab asks a Channel partner to sponsor (paid sponsorship) a GitLab led initiative. GitLab and the Channel partner will collaborate and agree on a clearly laid out plan for how the leads will be jointly worked in advance of the activity taking place.
- Please remember that from a sales perspective, channel deals (MQLs, SAOs, PSOs and won deals) are considered comp neutral so both the partner and the GitLab sales field team gets compensated. So for every deal/lead/PIO/Closed partner deal we ALL get 'credit'.

### Tracking success of FMM campaigns with Channel
GitLab Field Marketing receives `credit`for the Partner Sourced Opportunity if the opportunity has a Bizible touchpoint from the FMM campaign.
 
* [This report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004ap4S) shows all SAOs from Field Marketing campaigns run with channel partners - this report is useful for CAMs to review to see if they have partner attribution missing from an opportunity in addition to the FMM having the ability to review the ROI of the campaign.
* [This report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004apjz) shows all partner influenced opportunities from all field marketing campaigns regardless or not if a channel partner was explicitly involved or not.

### Here’s a quick rundown (not exhaustive) of what the Channel Program team handles

1. Manage/create SPIFFs
1. Manage Partner Advisory Boards
1. Set up MDF program
1. Manage the updates of the handbook
1. Operationally Manages Channel Partner Portal

If you are a FMM receiving requests to add a partner logo to our website, then please direct the CAM or partner to Channel Marketing.

If you are a FMM receiving questions about the Channel Portal, then please direct the CAM or partner to Channel Programs.

# Field Marketing - Public Sector

## Charitable Donations for Event Attendance

As incentive for attending an event, GitLab can promote and process a monetary donation per participant to a charitable organization. For example: GitLab promotes a $25 donation per attendee for attending an event, 100 attendees participate in the event and GitLab donates $2,500 to the selected charity. **Please Note**: Donations are not to be made in a participant's name or reference a participant's organization.

## Public Sector Team Lead - Staff Field Marketing Manager

Within our public sector team we have a team lead. Our PubSec Team Lead will:

- Lead PubSec Field marketing strategy and direction
- Responsible for the defense GTM strategy, tactics, execution
- Supports channel - Alliance, SI’s DoD
- Leads content collaboration efforts from Field Marketing with Strategic Marketing
- Represents Field Marketing team on the public sector team call, speaking and documenting content to be discussed
- Leads GitLab Connect or major event in the DC area when pulling in multiple public sector verticals
- Leads the bi-weekly call with Director of Public Sector

## PubSec FMM Calendar share
In alignment with the PubSec team's [process to lock down shared data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/okrs/-/issues/150) that is accessible to teams outside of our US PubSec team - (will link to handbook page once its been created!) the Public Sector Field Marketing Managers, by default, will mark their calendar details as private. Google calendar [has a feature](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en#zippy=%2Cunderstand-permission-settings-for-shared-calendars%2Cstop-sharing-your-calendar-publicly-with-your-organization-or-with-specific-people) that allows you to share your calendar with individuals once its been marketed as private and at a minimum, the FMM team member should share their calendar with both their direct manager as well as their aligned Field Marketing Specialist, pending those people are US Citizens. 

## PubSec Website

Please see the PubSec website page [here](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/public-sector/).

### How to Edit the PubSec Website

We utilize [Netlify CMS](/handbook/marketing/netlifycms/) to edit the PubSec website. Please follow instructions for editing a page [here](/handbook/marketing/netlifycms/#creating-a-new-or-editing-an-existing-page-with-netlify-cms).
- You must be logged into GitLab to access Netlify CMS.
- Event listings do not drop off the page automatically after event has occurred, FMC will manually update the page with new event listings as needed.
- The PubSec page is listed under the [Solutions](https://about.gitlab.com/admin/) section as `GitLab for the Public Sector`.
- Note: Netlify sometimes shifts things around in formatting so when you look at the diffs in your MR, it may look like you have changed more than you actually have. The maintainer you assign the MR to will be able to differentiate what you changed versus what Netlify shifted.
- If you have an open MR and need to make additional changes to the page, go back to the Netlify PubSec application, make your changes and click save. This will submit an additional commit to your open MR.

# Working with Field Marketing

## Requests to Field Marketing leadership team

If you are a Field Marketing Manager and you would like to make a request in order to achieve better business results aligned to our values, please submit an issue using the [Field Marketing Leadership request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leadership_request).

FM leadership team will review all requests on a bi-weekly basis, and will prioritize as necessary or will share with you relevant issues if the request is already being worked on.

**Why we use this template:**
Funneling similar requests from a global team and addressing shared pain points in a single issue with a [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) will help to reduce noise and churn for other teams we collaborate with and ideally helps to improve a process that works for the WW Field organisation.

This issue should not be used as a shortcut to get questions answered but for request where FM leadership can help to improve a process which does contribute to our success as a team.

# Field Marketing Campaign Tags

## Creating Campaign Tags
Field Marketing follows [these instructions](/handbook/marketing/events/#step-2--campaign-tag-creation) for creating campaign tags.

You may use this [Campaign Tag creator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sHLtArCYoQtfVFyh3ECPfhxgkbSYwpDf9Q7Gsjj5N64/edit#gid=0) if you would like assistance in creating your code.  

The Field Marketing team will always associate a charge with a [campaign tag](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Le1PrWE1JbqN6Wz3D6tGfy7Ee5PmoetfyLPdwinFV0/edit#gid=627577696) when applicable. If a charge is not associated with a specific event, we will then utilize the below regional tags.

There might be campaigns we manage where we ask someone to attend or we get an invitation to speak at an event where we do not expect to receive any leads, therefore we do not need to setup additional tracking issues, SFDC campaigns, or campaign tags.

We may be given a sponsorship or have someone speak where we DO receive the leads and in that case, we create a line item in the QTR budget file with a $0 USD amount and use that tag.

## Regional Campaign Tags
**Swag Tags** - These tags are utilized for swag purchases not associated with a specific event (example - a bulk order of pens) as well as overall swag management costs (warehouse storage fees, order entry fees, inventory management, etc.).
- `swag_AMER_marketingfield`
- `swag_APAC_marketingfield`
- `swag_EMEA_marketingfield`

**General Tags** - These tags are utilized for any general purchase not related to swag or associated with a specific event (example - banner stands, table throws, popup displays, etc.).
- `general_AMER_marketingfield`
- `general_APAC_marketingfield`
- `general_EMEA_marketingfield`

**Shipping Tags** - These tags are utilized for shipping charges. Example - Shipping charges through our [Field Marketing Fedex Account](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-fedex-account).
- `shipping_AMER_marketingfield`
- `shipping_APAC_marketingfield`
- `shipping_EMEA_marketingfield`

# The Field Marketing Budget

Field Marketing manages its budget in [Allocadia](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/). Specific instructions on how we manage our expenses:

1. Each FMM will have a qtrly allocation of money to spend based on territory pipeline needs.
1. Every month on t -6 days (so 6 business days before the start of the next month) finance will do a pull of this data and push it into the company planning tool called Adaptive. Field Marketing Managers must always keep their budgets up to date, but it is essential the budget is accurate for the month prior to t -6 days, as FMM Leadership reviews the budget vs. actuals on a monthly basis. 
   * Via Geekbot, each FMM will receive a reminder t-8 days before the start of the next month - or 2 days before the monthly forecast is due to Finance. 
1. Direct Mail accrual process - Spend should be planned and expensed in the month in which they are sent out to recipients vs. the month in which the recipient could use the direct mail piece, as we have no control over when a gift card (as an example) is used.
1. Survey accrual process - If you are using a 3rd party to complete a survey, it’s the responsibility of the FMM DRI to account for the percent of work that was completed in that month in the budget. As an example, if you signed a contract with a vendor to complete 100 surveys, and in month 1, 50 of the 100 contracted for surveys were completed, then you would account for 50% of the expense in month 1.
   * This update in monthly expense is due to be updated directly in the budget document, in the correct month, in advance of the t -6 days before the end of the month, which is when Finance does a pull of our budget doc to run a budget vs. actuals comparison
1. Content Syndication accrual process - If you are using a 3rd party to run a content syndication play, it’s the responsibility of the FMM DRI to account for the percent of work that was completed in that month in the budget. As an example, if you signed a contract with a vendor to complete 100 leads, and in month 1, 50 of the 100 contracted for leads were delivered, then you would account for 50% of the expense in month 1.
   * This update in monthly expense is due to be updated directly in the budget document, in the correct month, in advance of the t -6 days before the end of the month, which is when Finance does a pull of our budget doc to run a budget vs. actuals comparison
1. The entire cost of the program is to be forecasted for - Sponsorship + lead scanners + monitor + any other auxiliary cost that the company will incur.
1. If the event is just 1 day, then the start and end date would be the same.
1. Any expense that is less than $5,000 USD will be expensed against your budget in the month it is paid. This is in alignment with our [GitLab Prepaid Expense Policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#prepaid-expense-policy). It is essential that you have this expense in the correct month within Allocadia. 
1. For expenses more than $5,000 USD (also in alignment with our Accounting rules), we recognize the expense in the month when the work happens, NOT when we the cash leaves our doors. 
   * As such, when you are running paid digital ads to support campaign work, you must account for the spend in a separate line item (this is aligned with our practice of [creating separate line items for each individual invoice/spend](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/#buttons). You will keep the same campaign tag for the digital spend, but you will need to account for the different vendor and different time frame in the additional line item. 
1. If you are running a campaign that has more than one tactic, and there are specific dates for the tactics, then each tactic will need its own line item in the budget and its own campaign tag.
    - As an example: If you are running a country specific campaign on CI/CD and there are 2 webinars and a workshop included in that campaign with a different specific date, then each webinar and the workshop will need its own tag, in addition to its own line item in the budget.
1. Each folder in Allocadia is protected based on the managers/DRI's for each region. Only those with permissions will be able to edit each folder. Please reach out in the #allocadia_mktg-budget-holders slack channel if you need permissions updated. 
1. At times, expenses are shared across an entire region or certain activity plans within a region. These expenses are housed in the ALL region folders. Any activity plans should transfer money to the ALL folder when looking to share the cost of expense. The same expense should NOT live in multiple activity plans if its an expense that is shared amongst more than 1 activity plan. 
   * As an example: If NorCal & NorthEast want to collaborate on the same campaign and they each want to spend $5k on the campaign, the FMMs would use the [transfer budget feature within Allocadia](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/#request-transfer) to transfer that money into the All AMER activity plan. Once in All AMER,  the correct sub-geos should be selected in the details panel so its clear how this campaign will support the different regions/sub-geos. Transferring to the All folders also prevents FMMs from having to divide out the MQLs amongst the various regions as well for ROI calculation purposes. 
   * In order for the shared activity to be pulled into the regional pipeline reporting for QBRs, the FMM will need to remember to also select the ALL folder in addition to their activity plan name in order to pull their full plan noted in [reports 3 & 4 here.](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/#reports-field-marketing-uses)
   * [Video walk through](https://youtu.be/w3Vs5lbBogU) - must be logged into YouTube Unfiltered
   * SFDC campaign owner will be the specific DRI for the overall campaign if running a shared campaign. 
1. For budgeting purposes we need to stipulate the amount in USD (as we currently operate in USD) in the FMM budget. 
    - When converting from a different currency, we minimally round up. For example, if the conversion of $500 AUD is currently $342.98 USD, then round up and quote $350 USD.
1. VAT and GST does not need to be included into budget planning as these do not attribute to program expenses, however sales tax in the US does.
1. As it relates to procurement issues being approved, it is essential that the contract details are submitted with the procurement issue, that way the approver is clear about what they are signing off on.
    - In FY22, we aim for an MQL to not cost us more than $500, should a contract be submitted that is over the $500 goal, there needs to be a documented reason + path to success shown in the procurement issue. It is the responsibility of the FMM Country Manager to ensure this documentation is listed in the procurement issue before the issue is sent on to further leadership to review/approve. For C-level and other campaign where we target decision makers, the customer journey needs to be documented and we acknowledge that the MQL might be higher.
1. Working through our Partner Marketing organization, Field Marketing can submit activities that can be considered for market development funds (MDF). In doing this, the entire amount of the activity needs to be budgeted for in the Field Marketing budget. We do this because the percentage covered by the channel partner will come through our revenue account, not our prepaid account and the transactions need to be kept separate. This also may mean you are over budget. If that is the case, then you will need to add a comment in the budget document and also clearly share this with your manager so that your manager may communicate this with Finance and Accounting in our monthly review meetings.

# Field Marketing and Legal 

## Legal Approvals

Field Marketing executes contracts with outside vendors to support the work we do. We do so by following the company [procure to pay process](/handbook/finance/procurement/purchase-request-process/).

We have an expectation of a 5 business day turnaround for a GitLab executed contract (could be longer depending on the amount of the contract & how many chains of approval the contract needs to go through).

If an issue has been sitting for more than 5 business days and does not have approval from legal, the FMC managing the issue is to ping legal in the issue reminding them to please review. If an FMC will be out of the office while a contract review is pending, it is their responsibility to assign a delegate to manage.

It should be a rare occasion (and not a result of poor planning), that a contract would need to be urgently (less than 5 business days) turned around. Only after all FMM approvals have happened, should the FMC ping legal on slack asking them to please approve an urgent ask.

## Sweepstakes

Field Marketing follows the legal team's process [HERE](/handbook/legal/marketing-collaboration/#contests-and-sweepstakes) for contests and sweepstakes. 

# Field Marketing Communications

## Slack Rooms we use

- [#fieldmarketing](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWDAJ8PK) - open to all teams to ask questions to field marketing & where weekly stand-up reports get posted to.
    - If you're an employee at GitLab trying to reach Field Marketing, please head over to our slack channel.
        - **NOTE**: If you're requesting we sponsor an event, instructions can be found [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#whats-currently-scheduled-in-my-region).
        - If a region specific question is asked in the [#fieldmarketing](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWDAJ8PK) slack room, please tag the [regional Field Marketing leader](#whats-currently-scheduled-in-my-region), as that person is the DRI.
- [#fieldmarketing-fyi](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01502JC5BK) - Official channel for Field Marketing Leadership to post announcements to the Field Marketing team.
    - Restricted permission levels to only FMM Leadership posting the announcements
    - Announcements can be submitted to your manager if you would like to something shared
    - All members have comment access to allow clarifications if needed on a thread
    - You are to react with an emoji (thumbs-up, eyes…) to signal to managers that you’ve seen an announcement
    - There should be no need to cross-post announcements (such as posting a link from another slack channel to the #fieldmarketing channel)
        - With a #company-fyi and the [#fieldmarketing-fyi](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01502JC5BK), all relevant info should be successfully communicated by managers to team members.
    - Default to issues first, then public channels when possible to avoid siloing work information to private discussions.
        - Use DMs for personal, private conversation rather than work communication (unless you are certain it is only relevant to the 2 of you or you need immediate attention).
- #fieldofdreamsteam: private room only accessible to FMMs - funny gifs, private questions for the team.
- Please keep in mind we have detailed instructions on [how GitLab uses slack](/handbook/communication/#slack).

## Monthly Calls

- The World Wide Field Marketing team has one standing call on the calendar.
- The team meets on the 1st Wednesday of each month.
- All team members are invited to each call although, if the call is scheduled outside of the team member's normal working hours, the team member is NOT expected to attend. The calendar invite simply serves as a reminder to the team member to check out the recording of the meeting the next working day and to also review the agenda.
- The purpose of the team call is to share relevant company, marketing, and Field Marketing announcements.
- Anyone on the team should feel empowered to add content to the team meeting agenda.
- We will also have a specific `lessons learned` section where each Country Field Marketing Manager will select 1 FMM event or other tactic event recap to review.
    - The FMM who is the DRI for the event or other tactic we will be reviewing as a team will add the `Event Recap` link from the `Event Planning and Recap` to the agenda
    - We review the recap prior to the call, the FMM DRI briefly gives a run down of the event or other tactic, then we dialogue.
    - Each region will be represented - AMER, APAC, and EMEA - so we will review 3 each call.
- We also discuss use cases - could be how you've worked with social media, how you built a report in SFDC to help the team be more efficient, etc,
- Guest Speakers - at times we will also invite other colleagues from the company to address our team as a whole
- As a handbook first company, if you are going to bring a topic to the team, please think twice on if you should add just an agenda item, or if you should add an agenda item that links to an MR or a handbook page.
- If you're not on the Field Marketing team at GitLab and you're a GitLab employee who's interested in joining our team meeting, please feel free to ask in the #fieldmarketing slack room, we'd welcome the opportunity to host you!

## Async Status Updates

Since we are a [remote](/company/culture/all-remote/) company, we utilize a Slack plugin called [Geekbot](https://geekbot.io/) to coordinate status updates. Field Marketing world wide currently conducts 1 weekly standup. Geekbot shares this update in the public #fieldmarketing slack room.

## Weekly Status Update

The **Weekly Status Update** is configured to run at 9 AM local time on Monday, and contains a series of rotating questions. Below is an example of questions you may see:

1. _**What was your favorite part of the weekend?**_
The goal with this question is for you to get to know your colleagues and for you to be able to share what excited you from the previous few days when you weren't working.
1. _**What's happening in your life?**_
Is there anything you'd like the team to know about what's going in your life? Feel free to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing.
1. <i>**Are you traveling anywhere this week? If so, where and why.**</i> <--- This question is paused for the moment. :)
As Field Marketers, we travel up to 50% of the time. Sharing where you are is important, especially if are in a different timezone.
1. _**What are your top 1-3 priorities for the next week?**_
These top 3 priorities should be focused on what you plan to accomplish that week.
1. _**Anything blocking your progress?**_
Of those 1-3 items listed, do you need any roadblocks removed in order to accomplish the priorities?

You will be notified via the Geekbot plug in on slack at 9 AM your local time on Mondays, as stated above. It is important to note, that unless you answer all questions in the Geekbot plug in, your answers will NOT be shared with your colleagues, so please be sure to complete all questions!

## Out of Office Processes 
We follow the processes documented in the [Communicating your time off section](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off) of our handbook page. 

Specifically: 
1. Add your OOO to PTO by Roots 
1. Add an OOO for your email 
1. Turn on [Google Calendar's "out of office" setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) (scroll down to "Show when you’re out of office") to create an out of office event that will automatically decline new and existing meetings for you.
1. Add an OOO to your Slack profile 
1. Ad an OOO to your GitLab profile and mark yourself as `busy` 

# Field Marketing MR process

Everyone can contribute, although not everyone has merge rights. Within the Field Marketing team, when someone submits an MR, the submitter needs to assign to their direct line manager to review, and then their manager will assign to the Director of Field Marketing to review. Once the Director has reviewed/approved, it is their responsibility to ensure all threads are addressed and resolved and all merge conflicts are resolved, then merge. 

Should a Country Manager of Field Marketing or Director of Field Marketing submit a process change in the handbook, then all Country Managers should sign off via approving the MR or commenting their approval. At which point, the Director ensures all threads are addressed and resolved and all merge conflicts are resolved, then the Director will merge.

# Creating a spif for sales 
At times, Field Marketers may want to create a SPIF (sales performance incentive fund) to help drive sales behavior in a campaign they are running. While this should not be our standard to offer a SPIF, should one need to be used, we do need to report back to payroll any incentve that was paid and to who. The process is as follows: 
1. There is no payment threshold that would not need to be reported. All SPIFs must be reported. 
1. The SPIF DRI should send the legal name of the winners to payroll 
1. The SPIF DRI should include the amount of money (or value of the prize, if a prize was offered) to payroll
1. Contact info for payroll can be found [here on their handbook page](/handbook/finance/payroll/).

# Field Marketing during COVID-19 Pandemic
The health and safety of our team members continue to be a top priority. Given the continuing situation with COVID-19 worldwide, our eGroup has decided that they will review our return to in person events on a case by case basis.

### Returning to in person events 
At this time, our leadership is open to Field Marketing building a business case for attending in person events. We still need to go through an approval process to gain full approval. This will be handled by the following: 
1. FMM open a [in person request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request_in_person_biz_case) 
1. Regional leader/Director of FMM to review
1. Director of FMM to pull in VP of RevMktg & CMO 
1. CMO will make go/no-go decision 
1. If you are requesting approval for an inperson event that is more than 1 month away, then 1 month before the in person event is scheduled to take place, the FMM event DRI needs to confirm that there has been NO change in the overall GitLab travel policy that would no longer allow for the already approved travel exception. If an update was made in the GitLab travel policy, then the event sponsorship would no longer be able to happen. 

#### Field Marketing travel approval 
If you are a Marketer who is planning on attending an event, please fill out the [COVID Travel form](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/travel/#policy-and-guidelines) and attach to [this section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/request_in_person_biz_case.md#on-site-marketing-attendance) in the FMM issue.

If multiple marketers are attending this event, please ensure all COVID Travel forms have been added before seeking CMO approval.

Upon leadership approval of this issue, there will be no other steps you need to take to seek your own approval.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to the Director of Field Marketing, or your direct line manager.
