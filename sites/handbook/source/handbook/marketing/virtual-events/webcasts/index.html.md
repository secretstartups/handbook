### BrightTALK Webcast Calendar

The Campaigns Team manages the [BrightTALK webcast calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y19xdTVqMzRsZ2ZrcmlybmM5aGx1MWRkams0MEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which will be used to log all planned and scheduled BrightTALK webcasts and their related dry runs. **The purpose of the BrightTALK webcast calendar is to avoid scheduling overlapping webcasts and to provide visibility into all BrightTALK webcasts.**

   * Include a link to the issue in the event description
1. When the date/time/speakers of the webcast has been confirmed, remove `[Hold]` from the event title
   * ex. `TALK | 7 secrets of effective GitOps` or `RP | 7 secrets of effective GitOps`
   * Add the time of the webcast on the calendar event (if it is still an all-day event)
   * Add the epic link, and remove the issue link, in the calendar description

### BrightTALK Webcast Invitations
{:#bt-email-invitations} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

:exclamation: **Note from @jgragnola: we are working on further templatizing these invitations so that copy changes are not needed and tokens take care of these emails.** ([issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/3422))

1. Update emails `Invitation 1 - 2 weeks prior`,  `Invitation 2 - 1 week prior` , and if needed `Invitation 3 - Day before` with relevant copies related to the webcast.
   * *Note: We normally use the same copy for all 3 emails and simply tweak the templated subject lines to sound more like “Reminders”.*
2. Approve copy and send samples to the requester, and the presenter (if different from requester).
3. Go to the `List` folder and edit the `Target List` smart list and input the names of past similar programs and applicable program statuses to the `Member of program` filter. This will make sure people that have attended programs with similar topics in the past are included in the invite.
   * Note: We may uplevel this logic to include webcast invitations within active nurture programs to limit the overhead for invitation emails.
4. Once you get approval on the sample email copy, schedule the email programs outlined in step 1.

### Add the webcast to the /events/ and /resources/ pages
{:#bt-webpage-listings} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*  To add the webcast to the /events page follow this [step by step guide](/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents).

### Switching BrightTALK Webcasts to On-Demand
{:#bt-ondemand-switch} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

BrightTALk will automatically convert the video to on-demand in the BrightTALK platform. The steps below allow us to further leverage the webcast in Pathfactory.

1. **Youtube**: Upload the recording to our main GitLab channel

   * Fill in the description with the short description matching the Marketo tokens (`{{my.contentDescription}}`)

1. **Youtube**: Once the recording has been uploaded, copy the video link on the right
1. **Pathfactory**: Login to PathFactory and add the copied youtube link to Pathfactory as new content by following the instructions outlined [here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory).

### Rescheduling a BrightTALK webcast
{:#bt-reschedule} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
