## Overview
[Interesting moments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/features/tabs-in-the-msi-panel/interesting-moments/using-interesting-moments.html?lang=en) are used by Marketo to show relevant information to the sales team and others in Salesforce.com

Interesting Moments show in two places on records, in the Marketo Sales Insight window or in the `Last Intersting Moment Description` field. This field updates dynamically every time an Interesting Moment is updated and date stamped.
