## Account Settings

### Integrations

#### Salesforce

The [integration between Sigstr and Salesforce](https://help.sigstr.com/en/articles/3075787-sfdc-integration-overview) allows marketers to:

1. Sync campaigns lists from Salesforce into Sigstr for use in targeted Sigstr campaigns
1. See which open and closed opportunities have been influenced and generated by Sigstr campaigns
1. Track which email recipients click on a Sigstr campaign and how often on an account and contact level

#### Outreach

Sigstr appends campaign banners to Outreach signatures every 24 hours. If they are changed from Sigstr, campaign banners in Outreach update in real-time. There must be an employee in Sigstr with an email address that matches the user or mailbox in Outreach in order for a campaign banner to be appended.

**Please note:** Outreach only supports sender-based campaigns at this time.

#### PathFactory

Each Sigstr campaign banner only points to one link. With PathFactory, you can use one link while providing additional content for the receipient to consume.

You can identify who clicks on your email signature banners and track content consumption using PathFactory. Using these insights you can optimize your email signature campaigns and content tracks, while simultaneously identifying highly engaged prospects.

To take the most advantage of this integration, pair your Sigstr banner campaign with an equally targeted content track. This v1 integration allows Sigstr to pass a visitor’s email address to PathFactory whenever someone clicks on a Sigstr banner. This means that anyone entering a content track from a Sigstr banner will be identified in PathFactory analytics. When using this integration and sending an email with a Sigstr banner to one recipient, when that recipient clicks on the banner Sigstr will pass the recipient's email address to PathFactory. This allows PathFactory track the resulting session of the known individual. When there are multiple recipients of a single email Sigstr handles identifying visitors differently depending on the scenario. 

Here are three different possible scenarios:

- Scenario 1: You send an email to multiple people within one organization (all with the same @domain.com)
  - The visitor sessions will be listed as unique events, but the email address "somebody@domain.com" will be associated with each visitor session
  - The email address will actually say "somebody", and the @domain.com will be the domain you sent the email to
- Scenario 2: You send an email to one external person, and one or more internal people
  - The external recipient’s email address will be associated with their session data
  - The internal recipients' email address will be listed in PathFactory as unique events from unknown traffic
- Scenario 3: You send an email to multiple people with different domains
  - Eg. tim@example.com, sarah@demo.com, and lisa@xyz.com
  - No email address will be passed to PathFactory, so the visitors' sessions will be listed as unknown traffic and will not have an associated email address

##### Adding a PathFactory track to a Sigstr banner

The demand generation and account-based marketing teams are primarily responsible for the campaigns that are created and used within Sigstr. In an effort to stay aligned with our go-to-market plan, please work with your approriate campaign manager to request a PathFactory track and/or Sigstr campaign.

1. Follow the [normal procedure](#create-a-campaign) for creating a campaign.
1. Once you are at the step for adding a link to your banner, select the URL dropdown and choose `PathFactory Experience`.
1. From the pop-up window, select or search for your PathFactory track. Your PathFactory track should be fully QA'd and finalized before using in a Sigstr campaign. 

### Notifications

Select the type and frequency of system notifications from Sigstr. Daily emails are sent every morning. Weekly emails are sent every Monday morning.

- **Engagement reports** - Emailed daily or weekly and show who has recently clicked a campaign banner. To opt in/out of your individual engagement report email, visit the employee preference center.
- **Install Reminders** - Send reminders to all employees who have yet to install their Sigstr signature. These reminders will be sent automatically based on the selected frequency until the user has successfully installed their signature.
- **Campaign Clicks** - Send real-time notifications to employees anytime someone clicks their Sigstr Campaign banners. These notifications include the date, time, and contact who clicked on the Campaign banner. Employees can opt out of these notifications by editing their profile. This will automatically enable Campaign Click Notifications for new employees added to Sigstr in the future.
    - **Campaign Click Notification Blocklist** - Ignore clicks from some domains (for example, clicks from email security clients). Currently set up to ignore clicks in analytics from GitLab employees.

### Privacy & Data

### Create a campaign

Before creating a Sigstr campaign, you need to [request a Sigstr banner ad](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#brand-and-design-issue-templates) from the growth marketing team. All Sigstr banner ads should use the same dimensions (900 wide x 240 pixels tall; 8px radius corners) and be delivered in a `.png` or `.gif` format.

1. Select `Campaigns` from the side menu (flag icon).
1. Click the `Create Campaign` button in the top right.
1. Select your desired [campaign type](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/sigstr/#types), name your campaign, and click `Get Started`. You are redirected to edit the campaign details.
1. Name your banner ad, enter alt text for the image, and upload the banner ad. All banner ads uploaded to Sigstr must have consistent dimensions to all other banners in our instance for consistency of output. Please follow [best practices](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/sigstr/#best-practices). 
1. Under `Clickthrough URL`, choose your desired link type (manual clickthrough URL, mailto, or PathFactory experience). Note that you must already have a finalized PathFactory URL before selecting `PathFactory Experience`.
1. Select the `UTM Parameters` drop down to add additional parameters for your campaign. If you do not enter additional paramters, the default parameters will be applied: `source=email_signature&medium=sigstr&content=employee_email` Note that your campaign name became the default parameter for campaign. You also have the option of adding custom UTM parameters if desired. It is highly recommended that you apply UTM parameters to your campaigns to properly report success.

### Review and activate a campaign

1. On the left side of the campaign edit page, click `Review`. You can also select the `Next` button to accomplish this same action.
1. Verify the look of your campaign. Ensure that the banner image does not appear blurry. If it appears blurry, try reuploading the banner image. If you still experience issues, please create an issue in the marketing operations project and assign `@sdaily`. 
1. Confirm the banner ad properties including the name, alt text, and clickthrough URL. Please test the URL to ensure it's working and that it leads to your desired location.
1. Choose your desired schedule for this campaign from the `Schedule` pane. You can choose to start the campaign immediately or at a later date/time. You can also set your campaign end date/time or let it run indefinitely.
1. If there is anything missing from your campaign, Sigstr will show you in the `Activate` pane below `Verify` pane. Before you can activate a campaign, you must enter all required campaign attributes (banner ad, clickthrough URL). 
1. Once finalized, click `Activate this Campaign`. You can also choose `Save Campaign & Exit` to save the campaign as a draft and activate at a later date.
