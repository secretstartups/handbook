# Learning Marketing Operations

At GitLab, we know how important it is to leverage the right Marketing technologies and tools to support marketing campaigns and generate sales opportunities. The tools can only do so much, it's up to the Marketing Operations and team to drive the strategic direction and adoption to maximize the results and impact.

To do so, we need to embrace continuous learning to stay on top of industry trends and best practices. This handbook page updated quarterly will be your main source of resources for all things Marketing Operations.

The Mops team holds a weekly "show and tell" on the internal team call. To see upcoming schedule or previous recordings, [visit this sheet (internal only)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iovZfsOppjj8SJW13Y9F_IYXjVCRnHd5FgbUDIUrPfE/edit?usp=sharing).
