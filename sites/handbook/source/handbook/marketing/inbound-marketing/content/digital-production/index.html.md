- As you work through the contracting process for the venue rental, please let them know you plan to have a small production crew come in to record portions of the event. Please get all required documentation, e.g. location agreement, liability agreement, photography/videography agreement, signed. 
- Please find out if production or additional liability insurance is required by the venue. If so, please acquire that policy. If you have questions on acquiring production insurance, please contact the digital production team *and* make a request for assistance in the video-request issue you created for this event.
- All video production costs for Connect events comes from the Corporate Marketing budget.
