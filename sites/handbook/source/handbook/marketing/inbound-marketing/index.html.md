### The Shared Drive
We have an INTERNAL ONLY Google Shared Drive named **Growth Marketing Shared Drive** where we keep shared documents.

## Process

### When you submit an issue 
You can expect these communications/notifications (either through GitLab or in a comment)

*  You will be provided with specific templates to help you input relevant information
*  Those issues will be vetted at the beginning of each week. The issue will either be: 
   *  Moved into `mktg-status::WIP` or;
   *  A comment will be added for what additional information is needed
*  The issues moved to `mktg-status::WIP` are then put into a sprint and assigned to a week sprint based on priorities, resources, weights and assignment loads
*  The `Assignee` will comment that they have received your Issue and when you can expect more information (ex: "On it. Will respond within the week on timeline")
*  If needed, the Issue Brief will be broken into a Project Epic with relevant issues and those issues re-assigned to the relevant DRIs as `Assignee(s)` 
*  A timeline  will be provided in that Project Epic or individual issue and the due date will be adjusted accordingly.
*  When feedback is needed the `Assignee(s)` will comment in the issue(s) asking for your input. They will be as specific as possible with what they are looking for comments on. 
*  Final deliverables will be added in the appropriate form (file, link to repository, web link, etc.) and the Assignee(s) will @ you
*  When final deliverables have been completed the `Assignee(s)` will close the issue. If additional items are needed please open a new issue and relate to each other.  
*  If an issue needs to be moved to the next milestone the `Assignee` will comment in the issue with the reason (ex: problems with testing)

   *  Never backlog PR issues without prior discussion

   > HANDOFF: This is where the handoff to Growth Marketing Teams takes place to run their processes

## Epics
This is how we use Epics to organize our projects. We aim to include the highest level information at the top level and specific information in lower-level epics. This is to 
keep a SSoT and avoid duplicative placement of information that would need to be updated in multiple places

    * Desired state - Key audience + Intent and Key company goals
    * Improvement Roadmap - broken out by quarter if it will cross multiple
    * Phases - per quarter and includes: 
      *   The Problem
      *   The Solution 
      *  Why this Effort

  * Epic per phase - one epic per phase
  * Contains:
   * Scope of project
   * Roles & Responsbilities Chart if different than the parent epic
   * Relevant Documents

## Issues 

### Issue Types
This is how we work with Issues and their scope
#### External

**REQUEST ONLY ISSUE**
*  This is for complicated projects (example: campaign).

     * [Requesting Support](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#requesting-support)
* Actions taken on issue: 
  * Reviewed for all information and label changed to `mktg-status::WIP` if all there or `mktg-status::blocked` if not all info is there
  * Assigned to a team member to execute on
  * Assigned to a Sprint week to be worked on (worked on= broken down into Production Issues)
  * Issue is added to a child Epic and execution issues are made for creating
  * Assignee will comment and close the Request Issue and deliver the work in the Child Epic

**REQUEST AND PRODUCTION ISSUE**
* This is for a simple ask (example: single asset)
* This type of Issue is submitted by a team outside of Growth Marketing and will contain relevant information for the project AND;
* Execution Items/Production Checklists for the Growth Marketing Teams.
* For each type of request we have a corresponding **Request [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process. 
* Actions taken on issue: 
  * Reviewed for all information and label changed to `mktg-status::WIP` if all there or `mktg-status::blocked` if not all info is there

  * Assignee will follow the production checklist and deliver work within the original Issue

#### Internal
(inside of Growth Marketing)

**PRODUCTION ISSUE**
 * This is an Issue we use internally to create and execute on the request/brief. 
 * These are only used by people inside of Growth Marketing 
 * For each type of request we have a corresponding  **Production [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process. 
 * The teams will deliver the individual pieces to these Issues, but not the completed ask. That should be delivered into the Child Epic created

# Vendor Management 

### Vendor recruitment

If you know of a brand or digital vendor, whether “an agency of one” (aka freelancer) or agency, please share the contact with your manager for further consideration.
    
### Vendor on-boarding

1. Manager creates [Access Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request) for relevant GitLab projects and Slack channels
2. Manager creates Intro to GitLab issue <link>
3. Intro call with Manager, Vendor, and Vendor Buddy to set expectations, outline workflow, share relevant handbook links, and introduce first project(s).
4. Vendor completes Intro to GitLab issue, including standard and design and or dev on-boarding tasks (depending on vendor type).
5. Help any developer vendors if they have trouble setting up their code environment and please familiarize them with our codebase.
6. Questions about on-boarding, please see handbook, your manager, and or thge [#marketing_brand_contractor_onboarding](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0114QFK8M6) channel.

### Vendor project management

#### Team

- **Assigning Issues to Vendors**
    - Assign the vendor and team member who will be the vendor’s buddy.
    - Ensure following labels are on the issue:
        - `vendor`
        -  `mktg-inbound`, `mktg-status`
        - `design` and or `mktg-website`
    - Assign the issue to a milestone, as appropriate.
    - Confirm the issue appears on the [vendor board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1511334?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=mktg-growth&label_name[]=outsource). 
    - Capture opportunities to improve vendor management in the [vendor management epic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/brand-and-digital/brand-and-digital/-/issues/248).
        

#### Vendor buddy

- **Managing Vendor Work**
    - Ensure you and vendor are assigned to the issue.
    - Check-in regularly to ensure progress and clear blockers.
    - Ensure projects to which you’re assigned are maintained on the [vendor board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1511334?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=mktg-growth&label_name[]=outsource), just as you maintain your own projects.
    - Communicate with vendor in issues and or the vendor-contract slack channel, [#brand-contractors](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C011PDBLWLC), per GitLab’s async communication best practices. Also be aware GitLab’s async model may be new to contractors. Be open to synchronous meetings as vendors acclimate to async work.
    - Meet standard GitLab and Brand and Digital work practices, including open and inclusive design and **weekly status updates**.
    - Review vendor deliverables for quality assurance.
- **Addressing Concerns**
    - Should issues arise, provide vendors feedback in private. Be specific on the concern, how it can be resolved, and set a date for when it will be resolved.
    - Share critical concerns or patterns of issues with your manager.
    - Immediately report urgent concerns to your manager, such as significant project delays or poor quality of work.

#### Managers

- **Vendor Boards** - Ensure [vendor board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1511334?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=mktg-growth&label_name[]=outsource) is maintained.
- **Vendor Issues** - Ensure the `vendor` label is being applied to issues we *might* outsource.
- **Vendor ROI -** Ensure we are planning sprints to maximize vendor output while minimizing vendor overhead.
- **Monthly Vendor Work Report** - Provide end of month reports on what each vendor completed, and any issues encountered that require stakeholder attention.


### Vendor invoicing, payment and reporting


#### Vendor buddy

- Ensure you know enough about the [invoicing process](/handbook/finance/accounting/#invoice-accounting) to assist when directing invoicing questions from the vendor to the appropriate party.
    - Please don’t drop the ball, we want vendors to be happy and get paid.
    - Please follow any questions from start to finish to keep things moving along.
        - Ex: “I’m having trouble with Tipalti, who can help me?” (Lori Lamb)
        - Ex: “Do I need a purchase order number for my invoice?”

#### Managers

- **Vendor contracts** - Negotiate and execute [vendor contracts](/handbook/finance/procure-to-pay/), with Director’s approval. Goals are to maximize value delivered within our allocated vendor budget.
- **Invoicing** - Ensure vendors:
    - [Set themselves up properly in Tipalti](/handbook/finance/accounting/#3-vendor-master-management)
    - Adhere to GitLab’s invoicing standards
    - Invoice all remaining hours by the end of month
- **Monthly vendor work report**
    - Provide director with end of month report of vendor projects, including projects in progress and those completed within the past month.
    

#### Director

- **Approve invoices** 
    - Approve invoices in Tipalti throughout the month and at end of month.  
    - Validate vendor invoices and deliverables with  Brand and Digital managers.
    - Ensure projects are billed to the appropriate budgets.
- **Approve contracts**
    - Engage vendors in alignment with brand and business objectives.
