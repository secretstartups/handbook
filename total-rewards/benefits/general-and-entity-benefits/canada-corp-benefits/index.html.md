## PTO and Vacation Information

GitLab Canada Corp's statutory vacation requirements are found on the [GitLab PTO handbook page](/handbook/paid-time-off/#statutory-vacation-requirements).

## Sick Pay
Ontario - Employees are entitled to up to three full days of job protected unpaid sick leave every calendar year under the Employment Standards Act (ESA). Leave under ESA runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Employees must designate any time off for illness as `Out Sick` in PTO by Roots to ensure that annual sick leave entitlement is properly tracked.
 
Quebec - The Act Respecting Labour Standards (ALS) provides for two days of paid absence per calendar year (January 1 to December 31). This leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Employees must designate any time off for illness as `Out Sick` in PTO by Roots to ensure that annual sick leave entitlement is properly tracked.

Québec - [La Loi sur les normes du travail (N-1.1)](http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/showdoc/cs/N-1.1) prévoit deux jours d'absence rémunérée par année civile (du 1er janvier au 31 décembre). Ce congé s'exécute simultanément avec les règles de congé de GitLab. Les employés doivent désigner tout congé de maladie par la catégorie «Out Sick» dans PTO par Roots, pour s'assurer que le droit aux congés de maladie annuels est correctement suivi.

## Parental Leave

**Statutory General Entitlement:**

* Employees who have worked at GitLab for at least seven consecutive months are entitled to [17 weeks of maternity leave and/or 63 weeks of parental leave](https://www.gov.mb.ca/labour/standards/doc,parental-leave,factsheet.html).
* Maternity leave is classified as leave taken by mothers near the end of a pregnancy or immediately afterwards. Parental leave is classified as leave taken by fathers and mothers to care for a child after birth or adoption. 

**GitLab Parental Leave Payments and Employment Insurance**

The Employment Insurance benefit is government financial assistance to parents who are away from work to care for their newborn or newly adopted child or if they are pregnant or have recently given birth.

If you are eligible to receive Employment Insurance during your parental leave, GitLab will top up the difference to ensure you are receiving full pay for up to 16 weeks of your parental leave. Your Employment Insurance application must indicate that you are receiving supplement pay from GitLab. The combined amount of your Employment Insurance payments and top up payments from GitLab will not exceed your normal weekly earnings. The top up payment will also not be used to reduce other statutory accumulated benefits such as sick leave, vacation leave or severance pay.

If you are ineligible to receive Employment Insurance during your parental leave, GitLab will pay you 100% of your pay for up to 16 weeks of your parental leave. Per the statutory requirements in Canada, you will be ineligible to receive any Employment Insurance payments if you are receiving full parental leave pay from GitLab. If you have further questions, please email Total Rewards.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

Employer contributions are made to the federal Canada Pension Plan (CPP).
