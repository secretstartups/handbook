## Introduction

For the avoidance of doubt, the benefits listed below in the General Benefits section are available to contractors and team members, unless otherwise stated. Other benefits are listed by countries that GitLab has established an entity or co-employer and therefore are applicable to team members in those countries only via our entity specific benefits. GitLab has also made provisions for Parental Leave which may apply to team members and contractors but this may vary depending on local country laws. If you are unsure please reach out to the Total Rewards team.

## Contact Total Rewards
For any questions relating to benefits, please reach out to [Total Rewards](/handbook/people-group/#how-to-reach-the-right-member-of-the-people-group).

### Benefits Available to Contractors

Contractors of GitLab BV are eligible for the [general benefits](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/#general-benefits), but are not eligible for entity specific benefits as they have an additional 17% added to the [compensation calculator](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator). A contractor may bear the costs of their own health insurance, social security taxes, payroll administration, tax details and so forth, leading to a 17% higher compensation for the contractor within the calculator.

Our contractor agreements and employment contracts are all on the [Contracts](/handbook/contracts/) page.


## Spending Company Money

GitLab will [pay for the items you need to get your job done](/handbook/spending-company-money).

## Stock Options

[Stock options](/handbook/stock-options/) are offered to most GitLab team members. We strongly believe in team member ownership in our Company. We are in business to create value for our shareholders and we want our team members to benefit from that shared success.

## Life Insurance

In the unfortunate event that a GitLab team member passes away, GitLab will provide a [$20,000](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates) lump sum to anyone of their choosing. This can be a spouse, partner, family member, friend, or charity.
* This benefit is not applicable if there is a separate life insurance policy as part of the [Entity Specific Benefits](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#entity-benefits) package.
* For all other GitLab team members, the following conditions apply:
  * The team member must be either an employee or direct contractor.
  * The team member must have indicated in writing to whom the money should be transferred. To do this you must complete the [Expression of wishes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBX6Mn5JhYuQpCXgM4mkx1BbTit59l0hD2WQiY7Or9E/edit?usp=sharing) form. To do this, first copy the template to your Google Drive (File -> Make a copy), enter your information, sign electronically. To sign the document, use a free document signing program like [smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/sign-pdf) or [HelloSign](https://app.hellosign.com/); or you can print it, sign and digitize. Sign, save as a pdf and upload to your Employee Uploads folder in BambooHR.
  * For part-time GitLab team members, the lump sum is calculated pro-rata, so for example for a team member that works for GitLab 50% of the time, the lump sum would be [$10,000](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates).

## Paid Time Off

GitLab has a "no ask, must tell" [time off policy](/handbook/paid-time-off) per 25 consecutive calendar days off.

## Tuition Reimbursement

GitLab supports team members who wish to continue their education and growth within their professional career. GitLab team-members are eligible for a reimbursement of up to [20,000 USD](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates) per calendar year (January 1st - December 31st) depending on tenure, performance, company need for the learned skill, and available budget. A course is considered to be included in the calendar year in which the course is paid/reimbursed (which should also be the same calendar year in which the course ends).

Follow the [Expensify process](/handbook/finance/expenses/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications) if the course is under [$500 USD](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates).

If the course is over [$500 USD](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates) or if you have exceeded your allotted [$500 USD](/handbook/finance/expenses/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications) limit for courses and professional development certifications, follow the steps below.


### Tuition Reimbursement FAQ

**Can I participate in this program?**
* If you are a full-time GitLab team member and have been employed for more than three months, you are eligible to participate in this program.
* If you are a part-time GitLab team member, you may still eligible to participate in this program but your reimbursement might be reduced. These situations will be discussed on case-by-case basis.

**What courses are eligible for reimbursement?**
* Courses must be a requirement of a degree or certification program and delivered through a credentialed college or university or effective online education such as [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

* Budget estimations for tuition reimbursement are based on utilization rates from past years, adjusted for the size of the company. The budget is managed on a company-wide scale, not division-specific. For example, approving tuition reimbursement for a team member in Engineering does not "take away" budget from other engineers. Eligibility is managed on an individual basis. Eligibility for this benefit is part of each GitLab team member's Total Rewards package.

For example, in the United States 2020 tax year if GitLab [pays over $5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center).

Please contact [Payroll](mailto:payroll@gitlab.com) or [People Ops](mailto:peopleops@gitlab.com) when you have questions.

### Tuition Reimbursement for English Language Courses

As GitLab expands globally, we want to support our team members where English may not be their first language. Team members are able to use the Tuition Reimbursement policy in order to take classes or courses that develop and strengthen their English language skills. Managers are encouraged to recommend this benefit to team members whose engagement as a part of GitLab and/or performance may be improved by further developing their English language skills.

Any full-time GitLab team member is eligible to participate in this program. Courses offered in-person or online by a credential college or university or an English language school are eligible for reimbursement.

To receive this reimbursement, GitLab team members should complete the following process:

1. The team member should first discuss and receive approval from their manager.
1. The team member should forward their manager's approval along with information on the English course including cost to the Total Rewards Analyst at total-rewards@domain.
1. The Total Rewards Analyst will notify payroll to process the reimbursement by the second pay cycle after submission, for Contractors they can add the amount to their monthly invoice and Payroll to be informed.

Note: The above process is not required if the course is being offered to you at no cost.

Examples of English Language Courses:
 * [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/language-learning/learning-english) offers a wide variety of online English courses in partnership with various reputable colleges and universities. Their courses range from improving your English language skills to more specialized courses that focus on English for STEM or career development
 * [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=english) has many courses for English. [Writing in Plain English](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-in-plain-english) seems particularly well suited for improving async communication.

   * [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) offers gamified way to learn English, plus other languages.
   * [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) is helpful for vocabulary building.
   * Use [italki](https://www.italki.com/teachers/english) to find a English tutor. 1:1 instruction is often necessary for continued improvement, especially once a person has reached basic proficiency.
 English Language Courses offered in-person or online by a local college or university or English language courses offered online by a non-local college or university.
 * Please add any recommendations and review to this list.

### Tuition Reimbursement for Your 4th Trimester

Your 4th Trimester is a 90-day coaching program with [Broad Perspective Consulting](https://www.broadperspectiveconsulting.com/maternity-transition). The purpose of the program is to help parents (regardless of gender) be as prepared as possible to be a working parent through coaching and development.

If you are a full-time GitLab team member and have been employed for more than three months, you are eligible to participate in this program. If you are a part-time GitLab team member, you may still eligible to participate in this program but your reimbursement might be reduced. These situations will be discussed on case-by-case basis. As Your 4th Trimester is part of the Tuition Reimbursement program, the cost of participating in this program will be deducted from your yearly limit of 20,000 USD. Please note, this benefit may be considered as taxable income in some countries. 

To apply for this program, please send a completed [Your 4th Trimester Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Q-Y8fg1WIf3TtiqlOaKWWOFbtBVpE3-UnVPXyMVDAg/edit) to Total Rewards at least 60 days before the birth/adoption. If the team member does not apply before the 60 days (for any reason), please reach out to Total Rewards and we can talk through different options. Your 4th Trimester is open to tailoring the coaching timing to each team member as needed. 

#### Administration of Your 4th Trimester 

1. Once a completed form has been sent to Total Rewards, the team will process for final approval. 
1. When all signatures are complete, Total Rewards will file the form in BambooHR. 
1. If the team member lives in a country where this benefit is considered taxable income (currently only in Australia and some cases in Belgium), notify payroll.
1. Total Rewards will send an introductary email to Your 4th Trimester to the team member and Barbara Palmer `barbara@your4thtrimester.com` outlining the expected leave date, expected return to work date, and date of birthing event. Barbara will conduct the intake with the team member and communicate directly for any coaching throughout the program. 

**Monthly Reporting:**
GitLab will provide Your 4th Trimester with a report monthly of any team members with an upcoming parental leave: expected leave date, expected return to work date, date of birthing event, country, whether the person has already opted in, and maternity or paternity leave. The purpose of this monthly report is to ensure Your 4th Trimester can plan accordingly to the volume of coaching for GitLab team members. 

**Billing:**
Your 4th Trimester will bill GitLab for this benefit quarterly with 50% at intake and 50% at the completion of the coaching program per participant. If there are more than 5 participants in a quarter, there will be a discount on the bill. If there are any tax implications for the GitLab team member, Total Rewards will work with payroll to ensure this is reported compliantly. 

## GitLab Contribute
Every nine months or so GitLab team members gather at an exciting new location to [stay connected](/blog/2016/12/05/how-we-stay-connected-as-a-remote-company/), at what we like to call [GitLab Contribute](/company/culture/contribute). It is important to spend time face to face to get to know your team and, if possible, meet everyone who has also bought into the company vision. There are fun activities planned by our GitLab Contribute Experts, work time, and presentations from different Departments to make this an experience that you are unlikely to forget! Attendance is optional, but encouraged. For more information and compilations of our past events check out our [previous Contributes (formerly called GitLab Summit)](/company/culture/contribute/previous).

## Business Travel Accident Policy

## Immigration

GitLab offers benefits in relation to [obtaining visas and work permits](/handbook/people-group/visas/) for eligible team members.

## Employee Assistance Program

GitLab offers an Employee Assistance Program to all team members via [Modern Health](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/modern-health).

## Incentives

The following incentives are available for GitLab team members:
   - [Discretionary Bonuses](/handbook/incentives/#discretionary-bonuses)
   - [Referral Bonuses](/handbook/incentives/#referral-bonuses)
   - [Visiting Grant](/handbook/incentives/#visiting-grant)

## All-Remote

GitLab is an [all-remote](/blog/2018/10/18/the-case-for-all-remote-companies/) company; you are welcome to [read our stories](/company/culture/all-remote/stories/) about how working remotely has changed our lives for the better.

You can find more details on the [All Remote](/company/culture/all-remote/) page of our handbook.

_If you are already a GitLab employee and would like to share your story, simply add a `remote_story:` element to your entry in `team.yml` and it will appear
on that page._

## Part-time contracts

As part of our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging  value, we support [Family and friends first](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second) approach. This is one of the many reasons we offer part-time contracts in some teams.

We are growing fast and unfortunately, not all teams are able to hire part-time team members yet. There are certain positions where we can only hire full-time team members.

Candidates can ask for part-time contract during the interview process. Even when a team they are interviewing for can't accept part-time team members, there might be other teams looking for the same expertise that might do so. If you are a current team member and would like to switch to a part-time contract, talk to your manager first.

## Parental Leave

GitLab offers anyone (regardless of gender) who has been at GitLab for six months and completed a [probationary period](/handbook/contracts/#probation-period) (if applicable) up to **16 weeks of 100% paid time off** during the first year of parenthood. This includes anyone who becomes a parent through childbirth or adoption. The 16-week balance is per birth or adoption event. If you live in a country where a statutory parental leave benefit is available, you will be required to claim statutory parental leave pay (if you are eligible) and GitLab will supplement any gaps. 

We encourage parents to take the time they need. GitLab team-members will be encouraged to decide for themselves the appropriate amount of time to take and how to take it. For many reasons, a team member may require more time off for parental leave. Many GitLab members are from countries that have longer standard parental leaves, occasionally births have complications, and sometimes 16 weeks just isn't enough. Any GitLab team member can request additional unpaid parental leave, up to 4 weeks. We are happy to address anyone with additional leave requests on a one-on-one basis. All of the parental leave should be taken in the first year.

If you have been at GitLab for a six months and completed your probationary period your parental leave is fully paid. If you've been at GitLab for less than a six months, it depends on your jurisdiction. If you don't meet the eligibility requirement as you haven't been at GitLab for 6 months, you can use our [Paid Time Off policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/#paid-time-off).

If applicable, commissions are paid while on parental leave based on the prior six months of performance with a cap at 100% of plan. For example, if in the six months prior to starting parental leave you attained 85% of plan, you will be compensated at the same rate while on leave. On the day you return from leave and going forward, your commissions will be based on current performance only. If your country of employment has specific laws regarding the payout of commissions when on leave, those would supersede our policy.

You are more than welcome to send an e-mail to Total Rewards if you have any questions about taking Parental Leave. You may also send us an e-mail to schedule a 1:1 call with Total Rewards if you need any support regarding Parental Leave.

### Country-Specific Parental Leave Policies

You are entitled to and need to comply with your local regulations. They override our policy.

Some countries require extra paperwork or have specific leave requirements, which are subject to change as legal requirements change. Please take a look at your country's leave policy:

* [GitLab Inc. United States Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#gitlab-inc-united-states-leave-policy)
    * [GitLab Inc. China Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-china/#gitlab-inc-china-leave-policy)
    * [GitLab B.V. Netherlands Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/bv-benefits-netherlands/#gitlab-bv-netherlands-leave-policy)
    * [GitLab B.V. Belgium Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/bv-benefits-belgium/#gitlab-bv-belgium-leave-policy)
    * [Global Upside India Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/global-upside-benefits-india)
    * [GitLab LTD United Kingdom Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/ltd-benefits-uk/#gitlab-ltd-united-kingdom-leave-policy)
    * [GitLab GmbH Germany Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/gmbh-benefits-germany/#gitlab-gmbh-germany-leave-policy)
    * [GitLab PTY Australia Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/pty-benefits-australia/#gitlab-pty-australia-parental-leave-administrative-details)

### How to Initiate Your Parental Leave

Some teams require more time to put a plan of action in place so we recommend communicating your plan to your manager at least 3 months before your leave starts. In the meantime, familiarize yourself with the steps below and specific leave requirements in your [country](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#general-and-entity-benefits) (if any). You must initiate your Parental Leave at least 30 days before the leave starts.

To initiate your parental leave, submit your time off by selecting the Parental Leave category in PTO by Roots at least 30 days before your leave starts. Your manager and the Total Rewards team will get notified after you submit your leave. Total Rewards will send you an e-mail within 48 hours confirming that they've been notified of your Parental Leave dates.

Please note, even though we have a "no ask, must tell" Parental Leave Policy, some countries require extra paperwork or notifications to a PEO so it's important that the Total Rewards team is aware of your leave at least 30 days before your leave starts.

### Planning Your Parental Leave Dates

Your 16 weeks of parental leave starts on the first day that you take off. This day can be in advance of the day that the baby arrives. You don't have to take your parental leave in one continuous period, we encourage you to plan and arrange your Parental Leave in a way that suits you and your family's needs. You may split your Parental Leave dates as you see fit, so long as it is within the 12 months of the birth or adoption event.

If you don't meet the initial requirements for paid leave, GitLab payroll coverage begins once you meet the requirements. Until then, you will not receive pay.  If for example, you are someone who qualifies after 6 months at Gitlab and then goes on leave at the start of your 120th day at GitLab, you would not receive payment from GitLab for the first 60 days. You would receive payment from GitLab for up to 60 additional days taken within a year from the birth event.

You can change the dates of your parental leave via PTO by Roots. Total Rewards will receive a notification everytime you edit your Parental Leave dates. Make sure your leave is under the Parental Leave category, otherwise Total Rewards won't get a notification.
Please note, if you are planning to change or extend your Parental Leave by using a different type of leave such as PTO, unpaid leave or any local statutory leave, please send an e-mail to Total Rewards.

### Taking PTO After Taking Parental Leave

If you need to take more time off after taking 16 weeks of parental leave, you can utilize our [Paid Time Off policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off). You'll need to return for at least 7 calendar days before taking any further time off since the full 16 weeks of parental leave will have been used. 

Please e-mail Total Rewards if you'd like to make this request and submit your PTO dates in [PTO by Roots](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#pto-by-roots).

### Returning from Parental Leave

To [alleviate the stress](/handbook/paid-time-off/#returning-to-work-after-parental-leave) associated with returning to work after parental leave, GitLab supports team members coming back at [50% capacity](/handbook/paid-time-off/#returning-to-work-at-50-capacity). Parents at GitLab who are reentering work following parental leave are encouraged to reach out to team members who self-designate as a [Parental Leave Reentry Buddy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/parental-leave-toolkit/).

Managers of soon to be parents should check out this [Parental Leave Manager Tool Kit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/parental-leave-toolkit/#manager-tool-kit) for best practices in supporting your team members as they prepare for and return from Parental Leave.

If you're interested in learning about how other GitLab team members approach parenthood, take a look at [the parenting resources wiki page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-team-member-resources/wikis/parenting) and [#intheparenthood](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CHADS8G12/) on Slack.


### Process for Total Rewards Analysts
  * PTO by Roots will notify Total Rewards of any upcoming parental leave.
  * Log and monitor upcoming parental leave in the "Parental Leave Log" Google sheet on the drive.
  * Notify the team member that the parental leave request was received by sending the confirmation e-mail (Only send this e-mail if the team member is starting their parental leave. Team members who are splitting their leave or changing the dates of their original leave request do not need to receive the confirmation e-mail again).
  * Notify payroll - add the start date and end date on the payroll changes file ("Payroll Changes" sheet for team members in the US, "Canada Payroll Changes" sheet for team members in Canada and "Non-US Payroll Changes" sheet for everyone else). Ensure the entry is under the appropriate pay cycle date.
  * Update the BambooHR Employment Status of the team member to "Parental Leave" with the start date of the leave.
  * Add another entry with the date the team member will return from leave with the status "End of Parental Leave".
  * Check local statutory requirements and if applicable, arrange any paperwork and liaise with appropriate parties (such as the PEO and payroll team) to initiate the parental leave.
  * 1 day before the End of Parental Leave date, BambooHR will send a notification to Total Rewards. Confirm the team member's return by sending the return to work e-mail to the team member and manager. If the team member or manager doesn't reply at least 1 business day after the End of Parental Leave Date, follow up again or ping the manager to confirm the team member has returned from leave.
  * If there are no changes to the End of Parental Leave date, update the team member's BambooHR status to "Active" and mark the status as "Completed" in the Parental Leave Log sheet.
  * If the dates in PTO by Roots change, update the payroll changes file and the BambooHR status accordingly.
