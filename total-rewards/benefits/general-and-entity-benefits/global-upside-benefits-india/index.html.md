## Life Insurance

Most companies in India do not offer life insurance as part of the benefits package. Global Upside, similarly, does not offer a life insurance plan to GitLab team members. Most workers in India will typically get their own life insurance which can be portable throughout their lifetime.

## Meal Vouchers

Sodexo Meal Cards are an optional employee purchased benefit. These Meal Cards work like a Debit Card, which can be used at any outlet selling food items and non-alcoholic beverages that accept card payments. If you would like purchase these a deduction from salary will be made each month. All team members are gien the option to opt-in for Sodexo cards during the pre-onboarding process managed by the CES (Candidate Experience Specialist) team.

## Gratuity

Gratuity is applicable as per The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.

## Loyalty Bonus Scheme

Since GitLab has terminated it's PEO contract with Lyra and entered into a new agreement with Global Upside (Effective from 2020-06-01).
All the Team Members based in India who work for GitLab are now employees of Global Upside. Due to this transition the team members who were about to complete their 5 years with GitLab have lost the Gratuity benefit as  they would have received otherwise. Also this situation can arise in the future too. Considering the potential negative impact to tenured team members, a Loyalty bonus scheme has been introduced.

**Claim:** One can only claim Loyalty Bonus after retirement or resign from the service after completing 5 years of continuous service.

**Forfeiture of Loyalty Bonus :** The full amount of Loyalty Bonus can be forfeited if a team member’s services have been terminated due to: a) His riotous or disorderly conduct or any other violent act; b) Committing an offence involving moral turpitude.

**Calculation of Loyalty Bonus:**

Case-1: If the team member completes 5 years of continuous service with Global Upside

Loyalty Bonus Amount =  Duration with GitLab before 2020-06-01 (Last drawn Basic x No. of years worked x 15/26) 

Case-2: If the team member has not completed 5 years of continuous service with Global Upside

Loyalty Bonus Amount = Last drawn Basic x No. of years worked x 15/26

**Note:**
- In Case-1, the gratuity amount will be paid by Global Upside and remaining will be paid by GitLab as loyalty bonus.
- The Loyalty Bonus Amount is provided by GitLab to the team members. Any amount which GitLab will pay as Loyalty Bonus would be fully taxable for the team members. Maximum limit for Loyalty Bonus is 20 lakh INR.
