### Parental Leave

To initiate your parental leave, submit the dates via PTO by Roots under the Parental Leave category. This will prompt Total Rewards to process your leave. You can find out more information about our Parental Leave policy on the [general benefits page](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave).

If you are eligible to receive parental leave from GitLab, your payments will be made up of payments from UIF and the rest from GitLab. Once you send your parental leave notification in PTO by Roots, Total Rewards will notify Remote. They will then get in touch with you to explain the UIF payment claim process. 


## Mexico

### Social Security

All workers employed in Mexico must be registered with and contribute to the following institutions that deal with different social security insurance benefits:
* Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS):
    * Provides medical services, child day care, accident and sickness compensation, pregnancy benefits and disability pensions
* National Workers’ Housing Fund Institute (INFONAVIT):
    * Provides subsidized housing to employees as well as loans, and the Retirement Savings Program (SAR). SAR provides employees with retirement benefits when they reach 65 years of age.

Employees in Mexico are covered by the Social Security Law, under IMSS who is responsible for administering social security insurance benefits and the collection of contributions.
* Both the employer and employee are required to contribute to social security, although the employer has the responsibility of withholding the employee’s contribution.
* These contributions fund retirement pensions, health and maternity insurance, occupational risk, day-care, disability and life insurance, and unemployment/old age insurance.

### Medical Benefits

* Healthcare Monthly Allowance will be paid by Remote as an allowance to the team members.
* The allowance will be 5000 USD per annum. 
* This amount will be paid on monthly basis with the regular payroll as a reimbursement.

### Life Insurance

* Life insurance cover provided via Remote (Details to be added by Total Rewards)

### Christmas Bonus (Aguinaldo)

* GitLab offers 30 working days pay (which includes total earnings + taxable allowances + commissions)
* Paid by December 20th (so the employee can use it for the holiday)
* Employees with less than one year of service will recieve a pro-rated christmas bonus. 

### Vacation Bonus (Prima)

The vacation premium is an additional cash benefit given to employees for use on their vacation. It is calculated as a minimum of 25% of daily salary multiplied by the number of days of vacation. Employees who have provided one year of service must be afforded a minimum of 6 paid vacation days in their first year of employment. Two working days will be added to that vacation time every following year through the fourth year. After five years, employers are required to add two days of vacation time every five years.
* Here is a chart on how vacations days increase:

| Year(s)  | Days |
|----------|------|
| 1        | 6    |
| 2        | 8    |
| 3        | 10   |
| 4        | 12   |
| 5 to 9   | 14   |
| 10 to 14 | 16   |
| 14 to 19 | 18   |

**Calculation:**
* To calculate the vacation bonus based on 25% and a salary of $50,000 USD per year:
* $50,000 USD divided by 365 days = $136.99 USD daily pay rate
* $136.99 USD daily pay rate multiplied by 25% = $34.25 USD
* $34.25 USD multiplied by 6 vacation days (first year) = $205.50 USD vacation bonus
* It can be paid right away when the vacation is taken, or as a lump sum upon completing one year of service (or employment ends). It is the employer’s choice which method to use.
* Unused leave must also be paid when employment ends (in other words, the employee does not ‘forfeit’ unused vacation time)
