## Specific to US based team members
{: #us-specific-benefits}

US based benefits are arranged through [Lumity](https://lumity.helloflock.com/login). The benefits decision discussions are held by Total Rewards, the CFO, and the CEO to elect the next year's benefits by the carrier's deadlines. Total Rewards will notify the team of open enrollment as soon as details become available.  

**The 2020 Open Enrollment will begin October 19, 2020 and will end on October 30, 2020. Your plan will renew January 1, 2021. _This will be an active enrollment, you must elect benefits in Lumity during the Open Enrollment window to have benefits in 2021._** Please review the information added on the plans for 2021 below and the [Digital Benefits Guide](https://guides.lumity.com/f8wiCGbj/GitLab) is also available to review. The Digital Benefits Guide includes relevant information as seen in this screenshot: 

![digital-benefits-guide-2021](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/digital-benefits-guide-2021.png)

Please review the full [summary plan description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAmlBXC6AZUy3vSNRjdcEgQIFCQP01L6/view?usp=sharing) of all related health benefits.

If you have any questions regarding benefits please reach out to Total Rewards directly. If you have any questions with the Lumity platform, feel free to reach out to their support personnel at `support@lumity.com` or `1-844-258-6489`.

Carrier ID cards are normally received within weeks of submitting your benefit elections. If you or your medical providers are in need of immediate confirmation of your coverage, please contact the carrier directly. ID cards are also available within the Digital Benefits Guide, Lumity mobile app: [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumity-employee-benefits/id1460901256) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumity.mobile) or available to be printed through the carrier website, [myCigna](https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest), for Cigna participants. Please see the [pamphlet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14GobIRVRGwmQTq_xEIjzczX0M3AV1eF0/view?usp=sharing) for how to use the Lumity mobile app.

If you have existing coverage when joining GitLab (e.g. coverage for an additional month from your prior employer), you have the option of enrolling in GitLab's coverage after your prior coverage terminates. If you wish to do this, you should register with Lumity during onboarding and waive all coverages. Once your previous coverage is terminated, you should sign up for coverage through Lumity on or within 30 days of the termination date by initiating a Qualifying Life Event and providing proof of coverage termination.

GitLab covers **100% of team member contributions and 66% for spouse, dependents, and/or domestic partner** of premiums for medical, dental, and vision coverage. Plan rates are locked through December 31, 2020.

More information on the processed deductions in payroll from Lumity can be found on the [Accounting and Reporting page](/handbook/finance/accounting/).

## Group Medical Coverage

GitLab offers plans from Cigna for all states within the US as well as additional Kaiser options for residents of California, Hawaii, and Colorado. Deductibles for a plan year of 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31.

For additional information on how Benefits or HSAs operate, please check out Lumity's [resources](https://employee-resources.lumity.com/help).

_If you already have current group medical coverage, you may choose to waive or opt out of group health benefits. If you choose to waive health coverage, you will receive a $300.00 monthly benefit allowance and will still be able to enroll in dental, vision, optional plans, and flexible spending accounts._

If you do not enroll in a plan within your benefits election period, you will automatically receive the medical waiver allowance.

GitLab has confirmed that our medical plans are CREDITABLE. Please see the attached [2021 notice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p3ht-qB2jwcjglj84nRTmMQX3rafWjCP/view?usp=sharing). If you or your dependents are Medicare eligible or are approaching Medicare eligibility, you will need this notice to confirm your status when enrolling for Medicare Part D. For more information about Medicare prescription drug coverage:
- Visit www.medicare.gov
- Call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (see the [“Medicare & You” handbook](https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you) for their telephone number) for personalized help.
- Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.

### Qualifying Life Events

Due to IRS guidelines, you cannot make changes to your health insurance benefits outside of GitLab's annual open enrollment period unless you experience a [Qualifying Life Event](https://employee-resources.lumity.com/help/qualifying-life-event).

A QLE is a change in your situation — like getting married, having a baby, etc that can make you eligible for a special enrollment period. You have ***30 days from the date of your qualifying event*** to submit your requested change to Lumity. You will be asked to include supporting documents (see [Required Documents](https://employee-resources.lumity.com/help/qualifying-life-event)), and list the date the change occurred.

You can start the process by logging into [Lumity](https://lumity.helloflock.com/login), selecting Benefits from the panel on the left, and selecting Update Benefits in the upper right. Lumity support can be contacted directly with any questions.

### Eligibility

Any active, regular, full-time team member working a minimum of 30 hours per week are eligible for all benefits. Benefits are effective on your date of hire. Others eligible for benefits include:
  * Your legal spouse or domestic partner,
  * Your dependent children up until age 26 (including legally adopted and stepchildren), and/or
  * Any dependent child who reaches the limiting age and is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability

Note: If you and an eligible dependent (as defined above) are both employed by GitLab, you may only be covered by GitLab’s coverage once. This also applies to enrolling in either your own supplemental life insurance or supplemental spouse/dependent life insurance through your dependent who is employed by GitLab, but not both.

### Cigna Medical Plans (2021)

Effective January 1, 2021, GitLab will be transitioning from UHC to Cigna as the primary national carrier.

** In order for the EPO plan to be compliant in all states, it has been set up as a PPO plan with bad out-of-networks benefits including a deductible of $10k/$20k, an OOPM of $20k/$40k, and a coinsurance of 50%. Please do not enroll in this plan if you are intending to use the out-of-networks benefits and instead review the Cigna PPO 500 or Cigna HSA plans. 

*** Cigna will provide an extended network PPO Plan for Utah team members which will include the Intermountain Healthcare System.

^ The linked Prescription Drug List is subject to change. When making a change mid-year, Cigna states that they will send out the following communication to impacted members: centralized notification 60 days prior, 2 letters before the change, and 1 letter after the change.

**Team Member Costs:**

The following costs are monthly rates which would be deducted from your paycheck.

| Tier                     | HSA | EPO  | PPO  |
|--------------------------|:---:|:----:|:----:|
| Team Member Only         | $0  | $0   | $0   |
| Team Member + Spouse     | $0  | $234 | $222 |
| Team Member + Child(ren) | $0  | $180 | $168 |              
| Family                   | $0  | $402 | $378 |

#### Cigna Infertility Services

Infertility services will be included in both the PPO 500 plan and HSA plan. This includes a $15,000 lifetime infertility benefit for each covered member. More details will be included in the SBCs once available.

#### Cigna Transgender Benefit Coverage

Cigna has advised they will provide [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/) compliant coverage for all plans. For more information on their coverage, please see the [coverage policy document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdsiFcTFEWsIidOXwPBcNNOCqFVERSXg/view?usp=sharing). For Cigna to provide coverage, medical necessity must be proven. It is highly recommended to go through the prior authorization process when seeking treatment. 

Please reach out to the Total Rewards team and Lumity with any questions or if you need help while seeking authorization for a treatment. 

#### Cigna Provider Search 

1. Visit [myCigna](https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest). If you haven't previously registered for an account, you will want to register.
1. Select "Find Care & Costs" at the top of the page.
1. Here you can select to search by Doctor Type, Name, Reason for Visit, Facility, or you can price a medication at local pharmacies.
1. When you scroll down, there are quick links for your nearest urgent care and telehealth.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

As an additional measure to confirm “Contracted Providers” (i.e. In-Network), it’s always a good idea to follow up with Providers directly (phone, email or otherwise) to additionally confirm if a Provider is contracted with Cigna or not.
Provider contracts change and sometimes the contracts change faster than the website maintenance teams for the insurance carriers. It's better to spend time researching and confirming rather than assuming and being stuck with *balance billing* from Out of Network providers.
*Balance billing* is if the Out of Network provider's charge is $100 and the carrier’s maximum allowed reimbursement (MAR) amount is $70, the provider is within rights to bill you for the remaining $30. A “Cigna Contracted Provider” cannot balance bill Cigna members.

#### Cigna Telehealth

Virtual visits for Cigna members can be accessed by visiting [myCigna](https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest), selecting "Find Care & Costs" and scrolling down to the bottom of the page.

## Basic Life Insurance and AD&D

GitLab offers company paid basic life and accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) plans through Cigna. The Company pays for basic life insurance coverage valued at two times annual base salary with a maximum benefit of $250,000, which includes an equal amount of AD&D coverage. For more information please see the [summary of benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rkA8n3zgZvnoiqzu3ZJuLwZ_9zMaNbZW/view?usp=sharing).

## Group Long-Term and Short-Term Disability Insurance

GitLab provides, at no cost to our Inc and Federal team members, a policy through Cigna that may replace up to 66.7% of your base salary, for qualifying disabilities. For short-term disability there is a weekly maximum benefit of $2,500; for long-term disability there is a monthly benefit maximum of $12,500. 

**GitLab Process for Disability Claim**

1. If a team member will be unable to work due to disability as defined by the applicable short term disability plan for less than 25 calendar days, no action is needed and the absence will be categorized under [paid time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/).
1. Since the short-term disability insurance has a 7-day waiting period, the team member should decide on day 18 whether they will be able to return to work after 25 calendar days. If they will not be able to return, they should inform the Total Rewards team of their intent to go on short-term disability and apply for short-term disability at this time by sending the Total Rewards team a completed [Leave Request Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing). While the team member is on short-term disability (which covers 66.7%), GitLab will supplement the remaining 33.3% through payroll if the team member has been employed for more than six months. Benefit coverage will also continue for the time the team member is on short-term disability.
1. At the end of the maximum benefit period for short-term disability of 12 weeks, the team member will determine whether they are able to return back to work. 
    * If the team member intends to return on or before the end of the 12 weeks, they should provide the Total Rewards team a Return to Work authorization from their doctor stating that they are able to return to work and listing any accomodations needed, if applicable, before their return date. The Total Rewards team should request this a week before the team member's anticipated return to work date if not already provided by the team member.
    * If the team member is unable to return, the team member will be moved to unpaid leave and will have the option to continue their benefits by electing [COBRA coverage](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-consumer.pdf). The team member will be eligible to apply for long-term disability at this time.

**Short-Term Disability Claim Process via Cigna**

1. Team member will submit the [Short-Term Disability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing) form by email to the Total Rewards team at `total-rewards@gitlab.com`.

### 401(k) Match

GitLab offers matching 50% of contributions on the first 6% of allocated earnings with a yearly cap of 1,500 USD. As you are eligible to participate in GitLab's 401k as of your hire date, you are *also* eligible for GitLab matching contributions as of your hire date.

All employer contributions are pre-tax contributions. Team members can still make Roth 401(k) team member contributions and receive pre-tax employer contributions to your Traditional 401(k) account.

**Vesting:**

Employer contributions vest according to the following schedule:

| Years of Vesting Service             | Vesting Percentage |
|--------------------------------------|:------------------:|
| Less than One Year                   | 0%                 |
| One Year but less than Two Years     | 25%                |
| Two Years but less than Three Years  | 50%                |
| Three Years but less than Four Years | 75%                |
| Four or More Years                   | 100%               |

*Employee* contributions are the assets of those team members and are not applicable to this vesting schedule.

**Vesting example**

To help you understand the math, here is a hypothetical vesting chart showing how much the employeed would get if they left the company.

In this example the employee's salary is $50,000 USD and they max out their match every year. 50,000 * 6% = 3000. 3000 * 50% = 1500 match.

Year 1: Put in 3K, GitLab matches 1500. Leave the company get 3K (none vested)
Year 2: Put in 3K, GitLab matches 1500. Leave the company get 6K own money + $750 USD vested contribution.   (3K * 0.25)
Year 3: Put in 3K, GitLab matches 1500. Leave the company get 9K own money + $2250 USD vested contribution. (4500 * 0.50)
Year 4: Put in 3K, GitLab matches 1500. Leave the company get 12K own money + $4500 USD vested contribution. (6000 * 0.75)
Year 5: Put in 3K, GitLab matches 1500. Leave the company get 15K own money + $7500 USD (fully vested)

**Administration of the 401(k) Match:**
* The employer will use the calculation on each check date effective as of January 1, 2019.
* The team member must have a contribution for a check date to be eligible for the employer match.
* Employer matching will be released into participant accounts three business days after the check date.
* For team members who defer more than 6% on each check date, Payroll will conduct a true up quarterly.

### 401(k) Rollover

## Optional Plans Available at Team Member Expense

### WEX (Discovery Benefits) Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts

If you are enrolled in a Health Savings Account (HSA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA) or commuter benefits, the funds are held through WEX (Discovery Benefits). After your benefit enrollment effective start date, [create an account with WEX (Discovery)](https://benefitslogin.discoverybenefits.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) to manage your funds. You will only receive one debit card upon enrollment. To obtain a second card (for a dependent, etc.) you will need to login to your account on WEX (Discovery) or call and they will send one to your home of record.

If you would like to transfer your HSA from a previous account, please contact WEX (Discovery) and request a HSA Transfer funds form. On the form you will put your old HSA provider’s account number and any other required personal information. You will then submit the form to WEX (Discovery), and they will get in contact with your old HSA provider and process the transfer of funds. You can reach WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`. If you would like to adjust your HSA contributions please log into [Lumity](https://lumity.helloflock.com/login). HSAs roll over completely year-to-year, and FSAs have a $550 rollover each calendar year. If you leave GitLab and would like to keep your HSA account, GitLab will no longer be responsible for the administration fee. The account holder will become responsible for the $2.50 per month admin fee. 

FSAs are employer-owned accounts. If you leave GitLab, you cannot take FSA accounts with you. You are able to use your full FSA amounts up to and on your last day, but not afterwards. Your FSA benefits stop on your termination date. WEX (Discovery) asks that all claims be submitted up to 90 days after termination date. For additional information, please reach out to WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`.

FSAs (and Dependent Care FSAs) are subject to annual testing by the Internal Revenue Code guidelines to ensure the pre-tax benefits do not disproportionately benefit highly compensated employees. At the end of each plan year, GitLab will work with Lumity to conduct the nondiscrimination testing. If a test returns that highly compensated employees benefit, you may not be able to pre-tax the full amount of your election. This can vary each year and is based upon the dollar amount of non-highly compensated employees’ elections. 

#### Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Plans

FSAs help you pay for eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent day care expenses on a pretax basis. You determine your projected expenses for the Plan Year and then elect to set aside a portion of each paycheck into your FSA.

##### FSA Period to Submit Claims

Up to 90 days after the plan year has concluded (also known as the runout period).

#### Commuter Benefits

GitLab offers [commuter benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPek1Ia0ZqYjhuT25zYjdYTUpiS1NFSXFXc0Vn/view?usp=sharing) which are administered through WEX (Discovery Benefits). The contribution limits from the IRS for 2020 are $270/month for parking and $270/month for transit. These contributions rollover month to month.

##### Commuter Benefits Period to Submit Claims

For active employees: Up to 180 days after plan year has concluded (also known as the runout period).

For terminated employees: Up to 90 days after the termination date.

### Cigna Supplemental Life Insurance/AD&D

Team members who wish to elect additional life insurance above what is provided by GitLab through the Basic Life Insurance or elect life insurance for their dependents, can elect [Voluntary Life Insurance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yY1tFJTuj1wCMlorUvnfcgWwZUuP279r/view?usp=sharing) through Cigna.

   * $10,000 Increments up to the lesser of 6x annual salary or $750,000 for team members
   * $5,000 Increments up to the lesser of $250,000 or 100% of team member election for spouses and domestic partners
   * $10,000 of coverage available for children

##### Evidence of Insurability

If you elect supplemental life insurance greater than the guaranteed issue of voluntary life insurance for yourself or dependent, you or your dependent may be required to complete an evidence of insurability (EOI). If required, you will be prompted and provided with the form during the enrollment process. 

Please complete this form to the best of your ability, but if you're unsure for any field, please leave it blank. No information needs to be filled out for the ID # field and for security, you may also leave the Social Security Number field blank. 

Once complete, please send the form to `total-rewards@ domain` and `support@lumity.com`. Lumity and the Total Rewards team will then help fill in any missing information, if applicable, and Lumity will forward to the carrier for review. Lumity will confirm receipt of the EOI with the carrier, track its status, and reach out to the team member with any issues that need to be addressed in order for the EOI to be approved.

If you leave GitLab, all supplemental life insurance is not included in COBRA and will terminate on your last day at GitLab unless you choose to continue your or your spouse/children's life insurance directly with the carrier. Please contact the carrier (Cigna) for more information on premiums and setting this up.

## GitLab Inc. United States Leave Policy

Based on the Family and Medical Leave Act, or [FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla), US team members are "eligible to take job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the team member had not taken leave." For more information on what defines an eligible team member and medical reason please visit the [Electronic Code of Federal Regulation](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=d178a2522c85f1f401ed3f3740984fed&rgn=div5&view=text&node=29:3.1.1.3.54&idno=29#sp29.3.825.b) for the most up to date data.

### Apply For Parental Leave in the US

1. Notify the Total Rewards team of intention to take parental leave at least 30 days in advance, or as soon as reasonable by entering the dates in PTO Roots via Slack.
2. For a birthing parent (maternity leave), the team member will fill out the [Leave Request Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing) and [Assignment of Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pGqQsuzk3aEdG4srj78fXWrsRfb7jqB9/view?usp=sharing) and email the completed forms to `total-rewards@gitlab.com`.
      - The Assignment of benefits form states that Cigna will pay GitLab the funds and GitLab will dispurse those funds to the team member. The intention of this form is to keep payroll consistent for the team member via GitLab payroll vs needing to offset disability payments from Cigna. GitLab may need to offset any state related payments if applicable. 
      - Please see the Short-Term Disbaility claims process for more information on how the claim will be [processed with Cigna](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#group-long-term-and-short-term-disability-insurance) as well as specifics on how to fill out the Leave Request Form.

1. TODO Outline process to return the team member to work

### Payroll Processing During Parental Leave

**Paternity Leave**
Paternity Leave is not covered under Short-Term Disability, so if the team member is eligible for 100% of pay, payroll would enter 100% of the pay period hours under "Leave with Pay." Paternity Leave is also offset for any state eligible payments. 

**Maternity Leave**
For maternity leave, GitLab will verify 100% of the wages are paid for eligible team members through payroll, Short-term Disability (STD), and state leave pay (where applicable).

GitLab will recieve the Short-Term Disability funds directly from Cigna and keep the GitLab team member paid at 100% of wages via payroll. Total Rewards will notify payroll of the "leave with pay" status using the start and end date of parental leave.Total Rewards will also notify payroll of any state related payments which may need to be offset. 

## State-Specific Allowed Leaves

Each US state varies when it comes to types of leave employers are required to allow employees to take. GitLab's [Paid Time Off policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/) policy of "no ask, must tell" takes precendence but we still want our US team members to be aware of their specific types of leave in their state.

## COBRA

If you are enrolled in medical, dental, and/or vision when you terminate from GitLab (either voluntarily or involuntarily), you may be eligible to continue your coverage through [COBRA](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-consumer.pdf).

### Timeline
1. Typically terminations are updated in BambooHR on the date of the termination and once updated, will sync with [Lumity](https://lumity.helloflock.com/login) by the end of the next business day.
1. Once the termination has synced with Lumity, the information will then be sent over to [WEX (Discovery Benefits)](https://cobra.discoverybenefits.com/), our COBRA administrator. Government guidelines give 30 days for WEX (Discovery) to be notified of the COBRA eligibility, but typically this will take about 1-2 weeks.
1. Once notified, WEX (Discovery) has 14 days to generate and send the COBRA enrollment packet. Allow normal mailing timelines (5-10 business days) to receive the packet once sent.
1. You will have 60 days from the time you receive the COBRA packet to enroll either through the mail or online. Instructions for how to enroll will be included in your COBRA packet. Coverage will be retro-effective to the date coverage was lost.
1. From the day you enroll, you have 45 days to bring your payments to current.
1. You may remain on COBRA for up to 18 months. Please see the COBRA enrollment packet for information on extending COBRA an additional 18 months, if applicable. The state you reside in may allow for additional time on COBRA, but may be more expensive and include only Medical. Please consult the laws for your state for more information.

If you are currently employed and have any general COBRA questions, feel free to contact the Compensation & Benefits team. If you have terminated already or have specific questions on the administration of COBRA, feel free to contact WEX (Discovery) Benefits directly: (866) 451-3399.

1. In the same "Funding Summary" tab, review the difference calculated in cell L3. This difference should be positive and roughly equivalent to the amount we currently have available in our Funding Account for WEX (Discovery), typically in the range of $5,000 to $50,000.
