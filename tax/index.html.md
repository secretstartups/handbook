# Contacting the Tax Team

The tax department is responsible for GitLab’s overall tax strategy including all components of tax compliance, tax planning and accounting for income taxes. Tax regulations taxation differ between countries, which can make this area complex. The tax team is here to support you, make it simple for you and guide you through the landscape of taxes. In case you have any ad-hoc questions please feel free reach out on the #tax channel on Slack. For the sake of clarity please do not use it to seek tax advice for personal matters. We will try to do our best to answer your questions on taxation of your #stock options though. For any in-depth discussions please reach out to the team.

# Organisation

The Tax Department is part of the Finance team and headed by the Director of Tax.  The Director of Tax reports to the Chief Financial Officer. For more information please check GitLab’s [Org Chart](/company/team/org-chart/). In addition, the employees responsible for entity finance functions have a ‘dotted’ lines towards the Director of Tax. The table below provides an overview of the responsibilities of the tax function in a [RADCIE-model](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#radcie):

This applies to all areas of taxation, e.g. Corporate Income Tax, Transfer Pricing, Value Added Tax, GST, Tax Accounting, Tax Audits, et cetera.

## Establishment of a NewCo

What are the prerequisites for a decision to establish a NewCo in a country where GitLab does not have a corporate footprint yet? It basically comes down to a combination of two factors: 

**Local presence** is a result of organic and exponential growth of the [GitLab team](/company/team/). At a given point in time the workforce in a country has grown to a substantial level where the demand for an entity is getting too large to ignore.

**Sales revenue** from certain [territories](/handbook/business-ops/#territories) where GitLab is active, can also lead to a demand from the business to establish an entity. A clear reason from tax risk management is to prevent that GitLab runs a permanent establishment risk in any of the territories.

To monitor developments and keeping stakeholders informed, weekly cross-functional meetings are held with Legal, Payroll, People Ops and Tax. FP&A is included about planned hiring for new markets.

## Tax Procedure for Compliance with Transfer Pricing

One of the consequences of GitLab's global footprint is that intercompany transactions are conducted between GitLab entities. For instance, finance team members in the USA support the German entity with daily activities; or backend engineers support development of GitLab's IP that is owned by GitLab BV. International tax law requires that intercompany transactions are performed at arm’s length. At arm's length means that GitLab's companies should agree on terms and conditions of these services that independent enterprises would also apply (i.e. pay for use of services, goods or intangibles). Intercompany transactions can be grouped into four categories:

1. Tangibles: e.g. finished goods, raw materials, fixed assets
1. Intangibles: e.g. IP, know-how, trademark, trade name
1. Financing: e.g. loans, guarantees
1. Services: e.g. management, research & development, general & administration, distribution, sales & marketing

### Intercompany Transactions at GitLab
At GitLab the supply of tangibles is non-existent while the other transaction categories are available at GitLab. The intercompany transactions between the entities are provided in the table below:

| Entity     | Intangible | Financing | Management | DS&M | R&D | G&A |
|------------|:----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| GitLab Inc.|            | X         |  X         |  X  |  X  |  X  |
| GitLab Federal LLC|     |           |            |  X  |     |     |
| GitLab Japan|           |           |            |  X  |     |     |
| GitLab South Korea |    |           |            |  X  |     |     |
| GitLab BV   |     X     |   X       |            |  X  |     |  X  |
| GitLab IT BV|           |           |            |     |  X  |     |
| GitLab UK Ltd  |           |           |            |  X  |  X  |     |
| GitLab GmbH |           |           |            |  X  |  X  |     |
| GitLab PTY Ltd |        |           |            |  X  |  X  |     |
| GitLab Canada Corp |         |           |            |  X  |  X  |     |
| GitLab Ireland Limited |         |           |            |  X  |  X  |     |

### Transfer Pricing Concept
#### Distribution, Sales & Marketing
GitLab BV owns the IP and therefore all GitLab entities that resell GitLab's products and services are required to pay an arm's length remuneration to GitLab BV. The remuneration is determined as follows:

1. An amount necessary to allow the GitLab entities to earn a net operating profit equal to 2.5%
1. In the event that net profit is below 2.5% of its net sales;
- remuneration shall be waived and GitLab BV shall pay a marketing subsidy so that GitLab US’s net operating profit is 2.5% of sales, or
- advances from GitLab BV to US shall be forgiven to produce the net operating profit of 2.5% of sales

#### Research & Development
For consideration of R&D services GitLab BV the arm's length remuneration is determined at cost-plus 6% on R&D costs.

#### General & Administration
For consideration for G&A services recipient entities will pay an arm's length remuneration of cost-plus 2.5% on G&A costs.

#### Intercompany Settlement Procedure
Each calendar month the intercompany transactions between GitLab entities are settled in accordance with GitLab's  Transfer Pricing Concept.

1. Accounting Manager prepares the balances in the Intercompany Settlement Google sheet
1. These balances derive from the AP and AR aging reports from Netsuite that are imported into the sheet
1. To the extent possible, intercompany positions in AP/AR between the entities are netted
1. The Accounting Manager sends to Controller for review and approval in the Google sheet
1. The Accounting Manager sends to Director of Tax for review and approval in the Google sheet

## Tax Procedure for the R&D Wage Tax Credit in the Netherlands ("WBSO")

In the Netherlands a tax credit applies to qualifying research and development activities ("WBSO"). In order to qualify for the WBSO companies need to file an application with the [Netherlands Enterprise Agency](https://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/wbso). In order to qualify, it needs to be proved that the R&D activities meet the following conditions:

* the proposed R&D activities take place in your own company;
* the technological development is new to your organisation;
* the development is accompanied by technical problems;
* the R&D work has yet to take place (in other words, you must always submit a WBSO application in advance).

When the application is approved, the R&D tax credit can be deducted from the wage tax due through the monthly basis payroll. The process for the WBSO from filing the application to applying the deduction in the payroll are described below.

1. GitLab appoints a dedicated engineering manager to oversee all R&D activities in the Netherlands
1. The dedicated engineering manager drafts the project description for eligible activities and estimates the R&D hours
1. The project description is reviewed by an external [consultant](/handbook/people-group/#organizing-wbso), Finance and People Group.
1. Upon approval of the project description the external consultant files the application with the Netherlands Enterprise Agency
1. When the Netherlands Enterprise Agency approves the application for the WBSO, a grant letter is sent to GitLab BV
1. The grant letter has to be shared with the Dutch payroll agent
1. The Dutch payroll agent applies the WBSO in the monthly basis payroll
1. GitLab BV's employees working on the eligible projects have to keep track of their hours spent on the project in the [hour tracker](/handbook/people-group/#organizing-wbso)
1. The hour tracker needs to be monitored on monthly basis by Finance in order to prevent an overclaim or underclaim of the WBSO

## Withholding Tax Management

The payment for the use of GitLab's software can be subject to withholding tax. Paragraph 5.3 of GitLab's [terms](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/#subscription) and conditions prescribe that the customer will pay any required withholding itself and will not reduce the amount paid to GitLab on account thereof.

`Fees under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes, including national, state or provincial and local use, sales, value-added, property and similar taxes, if any. Customer agrees to pay such taxes (excluding US taxes based on GitLab's net income) unless Customer has provided GitLab with a valid exemption certificate. In the case of any withholding requirements, Customer will pay any required withholding itself and will not reduce the amount paid to GitLab on account thereof.`
