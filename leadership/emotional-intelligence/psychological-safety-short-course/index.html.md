## Introduction

Welcome to Psychological Safety: Understanding, Empowerment & Self-Reflection

This is a short course designed to help with your understanding of psychological safety, provide pragmatic steps to cultivate a culture of psychological safety within in your team and reflect on some of your behaviours that may appear psychologically safe or unsafe.

We are doing this to ensure we create an environment where everyone is able to thrive, be able to easily embody our values of Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, DIB, Iteration and Transparency and the sub values that accompany this. In this course you will see how certain actions can lead quickly to erosion of these values and the erosion of trust amongst team members.

There are 2 ways to take the course. You can watch the [videos](https://gitlab.edcast.com/journey/psychological-safety-understanding-empowerment-and-self-r) on Edcast  or read the content, this is also best done on Edcast you achieve your badge. You are free to view both of course but the content is duplicated across the two mediums. 

## Introduction to Psychological Safety 

1. [Review the Psychological Safety Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/) 

2. **Welcome to Psychological Safety: Understanding, Empowerment & Self-Reflection**

This is a short course designed to help with your understanding of psychological safety, provide pragmatic steps to cultivate a culture of psychological safety within your team and reflect on some of your behaviours that may appear psychologically safe or unsafe.

We are doing this to ensure we create an environment where everyone is able to thrive, be able to easily embody our values of Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, DIB, Iteration and Transparency and the sub values that accompany this. In this course you will see how certain actions can lead quickly to erosion of these values and the erosion of trust amongst team members.

**Firstly what is psychological safety?**

- This was defined by Amy Edmundson as a “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking”. It's not about being warm and fuzzy and sharing your feelings. It's about being comfortable admitting when you are wrong or have made a mistake as well as challenging each other for the better. You can view a great video of Susan David explaining this further in the handbook, in the first smartcard. 

- Here is an illustration of what a psychologically safe team and what a psychologically unsafe team would look like.

[Psychological Fear and Psychological Safe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18kMSpBQBbJ0qvpviYxfegwP7_UXEG0zjMX3E_51srHY/edit#slide=id.g8c87dcb54b_0_0)

As you can see, the opportunity to live our values in the red zone is very difficult. Collaboration, Iteration, Transparency, Diversity of thought would disappear which will ultimately lead to poor results. We want to ensure we creating that green environment where everyone is giving the freedom to thrive at GitLab.

- Creating a Psychological safe environment is much harder in a diverse group of people. The risks to psychological safety is much higher, therefore we have to operate with a much higher intent and work together and separately to learn and grow our ability to cultivate these environments.

- Cultivating these environments is an on-going process as team members leave and new ones start. You need to always be operating with psychological safety intent.

## What Impacts Psychological Safety

In this section we will address 5 key things that effect Psychological Safety and this is certainly not exhaustive. This does focus on what negatively impacts Psychological Safety, in the next section in the course we will address how to tackle some of these issues and how we can cultivate a culture where these things do not arise.

- Punishment culture - If we don't allow reasonable failures to happen, risk taking diminishes, iteration stops and creativity is stifled. This is a sure fire way to create a culture of "we have always done it this way"
- Not allowing conflict - Disagree and commit is a sub value of GitLab and is very important in creating an environment where every one is heard, but still be able to move forward. This generates ideas, ensures many perspectives are taken into consideration when building process and products and avoids missing considerations which could have diversity implications.
- Not understanding communication styles - not recognising others communication styles will mean you cannot effectively facilitate conversations and meetings, miss other points of views and potentially isolating individuals. This is a great exercise you can do with your team to help understand each others communication style better.
- Blame culture - once we begin a culture of blaming individuals, much like punishment culture you reduce trust in team members developing creative solutions.
- Leaders & Team Members not embracing feedback - if leaders do not take on feedback from team members trust erodes, messages are not delivered correctly and misunderstanding happens.
 
You may be thinking that these are obvious, but in scenarios later in the course you will see how these things can subtly happen and erode psychological safety. Next you will learn what you can do to cultivate psychological safety.

## What you can do to promote and cultivate psychological safety at Team members and Leaders?

### Three Practice to Cultivate Psychological Safety

These three great practices will help you really make that push into ensuring that everyone feels psychologically safe.

1. **Perception vs Intent** - Ensuring that you are being mindful of this on both sides is very important. How could your actions be perceived against what you mean or how you perceived someone actions and what there actually intent was. Understanding your team members communication styles and work styles will go along way in avoiding this. We will talk more about awareness of this later in the course.

2. **Operate with a high intent** - We assume positive intent and on most occasions when mistakes are made where this is not the intent. A way to avoid these mistakes is to operate with higher intent.

 Higher intent is the practice of recognizing, reevaluating and reiterating on inclusive practices.

For example, you are an extrovert and enjoy participating in conversations in meetings, but you recognise that you are not the only voice in the meeting and some haven’t been heard. You use your confidence to encourage and provide space for other ideas.

This also means acknowledging and apologising when you get it wrong. People who operate at a higher intent do not use positive intent as a defence but as a learning opportunity.

3. **Have moral courage** - This is the practice of being brave even when it is a risk or inconvenient for you for ethical and moral reasons.

**Scenario:** Someone is consistently using the wrong pronouns for a team member who identifies as non-binary. They use the pronouns They/Them. The person doing this is at Director level and you have a great relationship with them. After an incident of doing the director doing this, you ask for a zoom chat and explain the issue.

**Risks:**

- The person is higher in the hierarchy
- You may not know there conservative or liberal views
- Risking the friendship you have with the person

### Nurturing Psychological Safety for All Team Members

It is important that there are consistent things that we do to ensure that nurture and cultivate psychological safety.

Everyone at GitLab can follow these key practice to create and continue the culture we desire:

- Embrace a culture of respectable debate 

We have our value sub value, Disagree, Commit, Disagree - to help embrace this practice.

It allows us to have those conversations that spark creativity, iterations and gather viewpoints that we may have missed. With our value ensuring that we still progress and move forward.


- Encourage and Share personal stories

This is a great way of ensuring that as team members we build relationships and ultimately trust at work. Coffee chats are a great avenue for this so that you are more comfortable bringing up pertinent issues.

- Practice self-reflection

We will have a task later in the course to help you practice this, but it is important that you are evaluating how you react and engage in conversations at work under different stress responses.

- Allow for experimentation and failure
 
Again this is something that sparks creativity and allows some freedom for projects to not workout, provide space for our iteration and efficiency value to prosper. We don't want to be stuck in "we have always done it this way."

- Build a culture of curiosity

Ask questions not only about people's lives as above about sharing personal stories. Be genuinely curious about processes, practices, products and other things at work. Be curious and respectful.

- Be open to feedback

Always be open to both good and constructive feedback. Receiving constructive feedback should not be psychologically unsafe. Leaders ensure you understand how to give feedback effectively but also how a team member likes to receive constructive feedback.

- Encourage creative collaboration and collaborative learning

Collaboration is a core value here and we encourage learning. Allow for these things to happen together. For example, someone in your team may have a unique skill. Ask if it is possible for other team members to shadow them performing that skill.

- Seek diverse perspectives
 
Ask team members from underrepresented groups to avoid confirmation bias. It is so important that a diverse set of voices are considered in our day to day work so actively seek those voices.

### Nurturing Psychological Safety for Leaders

These are specific practices and actions for leaders and future leaders. Whilst nurturing and cultivating psychological safety is everyones job, leaders are in a unique position to have a disproportionate affect on this.

- Foster a pro diversity mindset and build diverse teams

Try not to build teams where all members look and act the same. Leverage your power to hire and promote URGs, regions and skills whilst still ensuring this is based on merit.

- Highlight competencies of team members
 
Much like collaborative learning, ensure you are letting team members know who subject matter experts may be within the team, one so people can learn but also help elevate voices on certain issues. Get to know your team members.

- Try to remove biases such as contrast and compare

Each team member is unique and was hired based on their strengths, try to avoid that contrast and compare when evaluating performance etc.

- Participative management

Try to dismantle perceptions of hierarchy by ensuring you are part of the team and not just the leader of the team.

- Avoid blame & keep negative feedback in 1-1

## Self Relfecltion Exercise 

- What are your stress responses? (When you are excited, angry, stressed etc)
 
- What are your actions when you are passionate and excited?

- How do you react to frustrated team members?

**Examples:**
    - When I am excited I am animated with my hands
    - When I am stressed with work I am less transparent and tend to to shut off 
    - When I am stressed in my personal life I can get distracted
    - When I am excited I tend to interrupt people 
    - When something stressful happens I tend to panic 
    - When something stressful happens I tend to be defensive 
 
- Can they be considered psychologically safe?
**Examples**
    - I am animated with my hands which can be a sensory overload for someone who is neurodivergent. That said on most occasions it is safe. 
    - I interrupt people often when I am excited which can cause frustration and make people feel as though their voice is not heard. This can be unsafe. 
 
- Have you provided your intent?
**Examples**
    - I want everyone to be aware that when stressful things happen I can shut off and just put my head down. If you notice this and feel I am not being transparent about activities please let me know. 
I am aware that when I am excited I tend to cut people off. Please call me out on this behaviour when it happens as I often don’t realise I am doing it. 
 
- What are your unconscious biases and have you challenged them?

- Do you consciously evaluate your unconscious biases when communicating

- How do you like to receive feedback, do you do the same, does your team know how you like to receive feedback and do you know how they do?

- What constitutes psychologically unsafe behaviour? Leaders and team members will provide feedback for example, that in itself isn’t psychologically unsafe but someone may feel that any feedback makes them feel unsafe. Challenge your assumptions on whether it is truly unsafe or part of the work.
**Examples**
    - Giving and receiving feedback at work should be psychologically safe if done correctly. Giving negative feedback should not inherently be un-psychologically safe.
