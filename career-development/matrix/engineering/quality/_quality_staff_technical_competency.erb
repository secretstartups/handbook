##### Quality

- Quad Planning & Coverage
  - Own [quad planning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quad-planning/) efforts and proactively optimize test coverage.
  - Create test strategy and implement test automation for new features.
  - Coach other Software Engineers in Test in effective and thoughtful test planning methods.
  - Proactively manage the competing priorities and potential collisions of concurrent projects to reduce risk, increase test coverage, and leverage efficiency gains in overlapping testing activities.
  - Identify and design potential new test frameworks, demonstrate their value, and implement in collaboration with other Software Engineers in Test.
  - Provide risk analysis and input on test strategy, refine tests at all levels to ensure efficient coverage and effective deduplication, and steer the team to optimal test coverage.
- Test Stability & Triage
  - Proactively manage triage and test pipeline stabilization activities.
  - Participate in test pipeline on-call rotation and ensure that pipeline failures are triaged, addressed and communicated in a timely manner. 
  - Take ownership of unquarantining flaky tests. Help debug failures to unblock the current on-call engineers.
  - Work wth Infrastructure and the counterpart stage to address test failures related to test environments or bugs in code.
  - Proactively identify and implement improvements to our process and test architecture to improve stability and reduce flakiness.
- Test Tooling
  - Lead test automation infrastructure implementation across multiple product areas in collaboration with stage group, functional area counterparts and Quality Department team members. Work across departments to identify, plan, and execute improvements/refinements.
- Test Environments
  -  Setup and maintain new GitLab test environments for your stable counterpart group. 
  - Leverage provisioning technologies (e.g. Omnibus, the Orchestrator, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, GCP, or AWS) and work with infrastructure and distribution teams as needed.
- Task Management & OKRs
  - Work on complex department initiatives that have an impact on the company's bottom line.
  - Owns an OKR.
  - Define and independently manages multiple projects within the department.
  - Able to create new methods for obtaining results. <br/> * Analyze engineering metrics and make suggestions to improve engineering processes and velocity.
  - Contributes to working groups as a Quality lead.
- Knowledge Sharing
  - Clearly document, review, and broadly share our process and knowledge. This could be across mediums (recorded videos, written artifacts) and may include activities like:
    - Regularly authoring and reviewing new content from the department to the company blog and handbook.
    - Recording demos and walk-throughs. 
    - Mentoring other engineers.
    - Participating in customer calls and taking part in Engineering outreach.
    - Hosting AMAs or office hours.
    - Speaking at conferences or meet-ups.
- Domain specific expertise
  - Demonstrate domain specific responsibilities within their assigned product group.
