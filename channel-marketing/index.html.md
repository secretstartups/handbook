## This page is intended for the following audiences

## Our Team
Global Channel Marketing team is a team of seasoned professionals supporting global channel sales objectives and providing support to the GitLab channel partner community and customers.  This small but mighty team is responsible for the development of channel marketing campaigns that leverage GitLab’s Go to Market Campaigns and value plays.  We work with partners to help them understand what the campaigns are, how to use them to help drive partner sourced opportunities, how to leverage upcoming GitLab webinars/webcasts to drive conversion and how to generate trials for GitLab that they can nurture with prospects.  Channel partners are ultimately responsible for the execution of these campaigns.  

The Global Channel marketing team provides support to partners by creating different campaign assets into leverageable go-to-market programs called Instant Campaigns that partners can easily pick up and run with their customer or prospect lists.  GitLab channel marketing is also responsible for the development, rollout and management of trial enablement programs by which partners can generate trials of GitLab directly from their website, and passing or providing trial leads generated from GitLab’s own website to be worked and converted by partners.  

Channel marketing also enables channel go to market efforts through MDF funding and management, by identifying upcoming field marketing events and activities that channel partners can participate in, and by identifying opportunities for channel partners to participate with Alliances partners and GitLab on joint go to market activities.

We partner with regional Channel Account Managers and Field Marketing regional teams to work closely with channel partners and GitLab Alliances for inclusion in their regional marketing plans.  

As a service bureau to a wide variety of teams, we have support functions that are both in and out of scope at this time.  We have ideated on a list of potential future service capabilities that, as this team is able to add resources and our business plan requires it, we will add to our list of service offerings.  To recommend that we add a service offering to this growing list of potential offerings, please create an issue.

## Quarterly Planning: Field and Channel

As GitLab evolves, the growth of the channel becomes a critical component to our overall strategy of growth and new logo capture.  With established teams in place, it's time to take our engagement up a level and as such, review how we partner together for proactive, and efficient engagement that results in high quality demand generation plans and delivering actionable leads for our sales teams.
In order for our collective plans to work, it's first important to verbalize the roles, responsibilities and focus areas for each functional team.

13 weeks prior to the start of the following quarter, planning for that quarter will commence.  FMM's and CAM's are expected to partner together and setup regular, consistent planning calls, preferrably bi-weekly. The focus of each cadence call will change as the plan formulates.  Specifically: 
*   ### Weeks 1-2 (11-13 weeks prior to the future quarter start):
Develop partner campaign objectives and set goals (specifically NFO SAO goals).  Set up recurring biweekly cadence with the individual partner, CAM and FMM to keep planning and campaign action items on track.
*   ### Weeks 3 and 4 (9-11 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
Based on campaign goals, identify the regions where pipeline needs are the greatest.  Architect campaigns to support that/those regions.  What are the campaign elements/tactics needed to create interest?
*   ### Week 5 and 6 (7-9 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
Agree to campaign tactics and persona targets, develop budget request and expected outcomes in the form of MQL's and SAO's.
*   ### Week 7 and 8 (5-7 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
Formalize/finalize the tactics, define action items and workback plan.  Identify any speaker needs.  Final agreement on MQL and SAO targets.  Complete FY23 Partner Planning Template and submit back to FMM and CAM.
*   ### Week 9 (4 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
FMM and CAM submit holistic budget request to Channel Marketing for MDF approval.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
*   ## Channel Account Managers 
Own the strategy, relationship and ongoing, consistent engagement with the Select partners in their territory.  The channel account manager is responsible for the holistic success and health of the partner relationship. 

*   ## GEO Channel Director
 Sets the strategy for the region, manages the Channel Account Managers and approves the criteria for Select and Open partner selection in the region.
*   ## Field Marketing Managers
In partnership with field sales, drive MQL's to convert to SAO's.  The field marketing managers are responsible for articulating which areas of the business require the most attention and where we need channel partner engagement to drive demand generation plans.
*   ## GEO Field Marketing Director
Develops the strategy and conversion targets for the team in partnership with field sales leadership.
*   ## Partner Program Marketing Managers
Develops scalable marketing programs to support Partners. 
*   ## Channel Marketing Manager
Responsible for supporting CAMS in specific geographies, by creating demand generation marketing plans with Focus Partners. In charge of planning MDF activites and improving Partner's participating in various Channel programs.

Once a plan for the quarter has been established it is imperative that the channel account manager and the field marketing manager stay in close, consistent alignment about plan execution.  The strategy is driven by the channel account manager, while the field marketing manager is responsible for executing on that strategy in partnership with various support teams, including but not limited to the channel account managers.

[MDF](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/analyst-relations/channel-marketing/#requesting-mdf-funds) 
CAN and SHOULD be leveraged as much as possible when the partner is involved in an activity.  Further information about how to initiate and MDF request can be found here.

## Tracking Success:
GitLab Marketing receives 'credit' for opportunities that are partner sourced so long as the oportunity has a BATP (Bizable Touchpoint) from the campaign.

## What is a Partner Instant Marketing Campaign?

With GitLab Instant Marketing campaign assets, GitLab’s Select and Open partners have access to marketing resources to help them quickly, and easily generate qualified prospects for their sales teams. We’ve developed turnkey, integrated partner campaigns-in-a-box, which we refer to as “Partner Instant Marketing” campaigns, so partners can simply and easily co-brand assets and execute!

These assets leverage GitLab go-to-market motions, such as DevSecOps and Automated Software Delivery, but are modified and expanded (in some cases) for partner use. Campaign assets include: nurture emails, landing pages, short videos, mini-books, social media and paid ads, quick sales guides and sales call scripts. All assets can be found on theGitLab partner portal. 

Our modular campaign is designed to be a flexible, self-service model, so partners can download an entire campaign, or a couple of assets, and the materials are customizable and co-brandable. These campaigns are also available in 6 languages: English, French, German, Japanese, Korean and Spanish. 

Here’s a look at our current campaigns available to partners by logging into the [Marketing Demand Generation section](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/c/marketing-demand-gen) of the partner portal:

- GitLab Free Trials 
- GitLab with DevOps

- GitLab Automated Software Delivery 

## Partner-Initiated GitLab Free Trial Lead Gen Program

## GitLab Hosted Partner Microsite Program

Content syndication can be a great way for organizations to get information and messaging onto partnersʼ websites. But often, this content isnʼt optimized for search engines, plus it can become outdated and inaccurate unless partners maintain it, and it offers only limited metric tracking. To help our partners have access to the latest content available, we created a [demand generation Partner Microsite Program](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/s/assets?collectionId=49429&id=429634_View). With a little information and commitment from you, weʼll build and maintain a co-branded microsite with compelling information for your customers. We offer the microsite in English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese and Korean.

Check out a [sample microsite](https://learn.gitlab.com/updated-partner-engl).

## How to Sign up for the GitLab Hosted Partner Microsite Program

- Provide us with your company logo, contact information for a designated person to receive and take action on leads and a value statement for your company (value statement optional).
- GitLab generates a co-branded microsite with content that is consistently refreshed with the latest GitLab solution-level messaging. The microsite will include a customer call-to-action for a 30-day Free Trial. Weʼll provide you with a unique URL to include in your nurture efforts. Note, the call-to-action for this campaign is for customers to take a 30 day free trial. We currently offer the Self-Managed free trial on our English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, French and German sites and the SaaS free trial on our English sites.  Note, you can add the 30-day free trial functionality to your own website by accessing [our Free Trial campaign](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#partner-initiated-gitlab-free-trial-lead-gen-program).
- You commit to running at least one full nurture effort (including at least three emails **or** a three-month Google ad campaign), pulling a target lead list with a minimum of 50 customers from your own database, taking follow-up action via either telemarketing or direct sales contact on all leads routed to your organization, tracking the results of the leads through your own Salesforce system, and providing GitLab with a report three months after the completion of the campaign. Note: You can create the content for your nurture emails or Google ad campaign, or you can leverage materials in GitLab's [Instant Marketing Campaigns](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#What-is-a-Partner-Instant-Marketing-Campaign).

*   Custom campaigns: Channel Marketing does not currently have the resources to support individual partner campaigns and events. Please encourage your partners to leverage one of our turnkey, and integrated [Instant Marketing Campaigns](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/instant-campaigns/) available on the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/).  For unique virtual and live events, the CAM should engage with their [field marketing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing--channel-marketing) counterpart to leverage field budget and marketing support for joint events.  The Field Marketing Manager will engage with their sales teams and support the CAM and partner with development, execution, and lead follow up for  the event.
*   Unique Partner Asset Creation: Channel Marketing is unable to work directly with partners to customize their marketing assets. 
*   Joint demand generation planning and execution: **The GitLab CAM is the primary point of contact to enable their partners run a successful campaign or event.**  
*   Event speakers: The Channel Marketing team does not have the resources to help locate GitLab speakers for partner events.

*   Sponsored social media posts: partners looking to GitLab to promote partner activities would not route those requests through Channel Marketing.  Instead, CAM’s obtain the partner’s social media channels and [create an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/admin/#open-a-new-issue-to-request-social-coverage) for the Social Media team.  This request should include the partner’s social media information, detailed description of what we are being asked to promote and target dates.  
*   Event attendance: The Channel Marketing team does not own a database of contacts by which to drive attendance to partner specific events nor do we possess the resources to support such requests.
*   Partner training:**<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> [Partner training](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/training/)</span>** is managed and supported by the [Channel Partner Training, Certifications, and Enablement team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/training/).

The role of alliances partner marketing manager is to own and develop the demand generation plan for and with our alliances partners based on the account strategy developed by Alliances Director and in alignment with company SAO goals for the segment and region.

While each account does have it’s own unique go to market motion the **following is a list of what the Alliance marketing manager is responsible for:** 

* **Develop and maintain the alliance partner marketing relationships.**
   * Our goal is to work with the assigned marketing manager but expand our relationships far and wide within the marketing org to support our strategic objectives. 
* **Based on the Alliance Director’s strategy, the Alliance marketing manager will develop a long-term, strategic marketing plan that reflects the goals and objectives of the partnership.** 
   * Alliances Directors must ensure the marketing managers have consistent visibility into pipeline goals by segment and by region including average deal size, sales cycle and etc.

         * Accurate lead flow
      * Marketo campaigns (unless executing a field mktg event)
      * Weekly reporting (Sales Accepted Opptys, New First Order)

Our team is small but mighty and there are a few things that are simply **outside of our scope as of Sept 2022:** 
* **Content development**
   * Alliance marketing managers are responsible for ensuring alliances messaging is incorporated into company lightning strikes, but isn’t the author of that content.  Solution architects or other subject matter experts are best suited to author integration content.  
* **Enablement content**
   * Enablement is a sales and/or technical motion and the marketing manager can review or include the training as part of a larger initiative (and should) but would not be the one to author the content.  Alliances marketing manager can also lean on our enablement team to help provide resources/assistance.
* **Sales incentives**
   * Sales incentives are funded out of the Partner Operations team.  The alliances marketing manager will include the incentive as part of a larger initiative but would not be the one to author or fund the incentive.
