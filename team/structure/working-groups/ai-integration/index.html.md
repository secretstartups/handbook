## Goal

The GitLab AI Integration Working Group aims to define, coordinate and ramp up integration of AI capabilities into all product areas

### Overview

[Corresponding Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9997)

We want to enable all product teams to be able to use advanced AI capabilities for improving and adding functionality to the product so users can be faster and more productive in their DevSecOps lifecycle. For product teams we want to establish a clear and fast way for going from idea, experiment to production when using AI functionality. Incorporating the services, models and knowhow that the MLOps group has built over time and can provide to the wider team.

The working group will facilitate fast experimentation and prototyping of AI capabilities. We will also advise on what must be considered (and in some cases, get explicit approval on) before moving to production, including legal approval, ethical use of AI, potential necessary changes to terms of service, performance implications, hosting cost implications, infrastructure readiness, security readiness, licensing of 3rd party software/services, appropriate GitLab licensing levels for features, value add in helping users achieve their goals and needs, etc.
### Goals

This is a list of topics that we want to discuss:

- Classification of AI possibilities and complexities
- Ideation and understanding how experimentation can be done
- [Rapid ML Prototyping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-g4DfxKgBRg7vJCGCIGIKL-XWtajyNQSXYldYWgAt4/edit#heading=h.cax3xpkdgfp)
  - API's and Framework for experimentation
  - Feature Flagged Prototypes
  - Determine how teams without Product Design representation can progress with validation
- Groundwork
  - Base API's for all teams
  - Infrastructure
  - Documentation
  - Understanding of Jobs and user needs to be affected
- Existing ML features
- Road to production for features
  - Different gates
