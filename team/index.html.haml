        More than 3,000 people have #{link_to('contributed to GitLab', 'http://contributors.gitlab.com/')}.
        The GitLab Inc. team consists of the following
        %strong #{team_size} team members
        and their
        #{link_to("#{data.pets.size}+ pets", '/company/team-pets')}.
        We're the world's largest #{link_to('all-remote organization', '/company/culture/all-remote/')}
        and we currently have team members in #{link_to(Gitlab::Homepage.team.countries.size.to_s + " countries and regions", "#countries")}.
        This page lists who people report to, and on a separate page we
        detail the #{link_to('organizational structure', '/company/team/structure')}.
        You can get a sense of the team culture and our #{link_to('inclusion', '/company/culture/inclusion')} by visiting our
        #{link_to('culture page', '/company/culture')} and our #{link_to('Identity Data page', '/company/culture/inclusion/identity-data')}.
