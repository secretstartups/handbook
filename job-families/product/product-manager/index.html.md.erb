## Role

Product Managers at GitLab have a unique opportunity to define the future of the
entire [DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/). We
are working on a [single application](/handbook/product/single-application) that
allows developers to invent, create, and deploy modern applications.

We want to facilitate [Concurrent DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/concurrent-devops/) so that teams can work simultaneously instead of sequentially, unleashing collaboration across organizations.

We work in a very unique way at GitLab, where flexibility and independence meet
a high paced, pragmatic way of working. And everything we do is [in the open](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

We are looking for talented product managers that are excited by the idea to
contribute to our vision. We know there are a million things we can and want to
implement in GitLab. Be the one making decisions.

We recommend looking at our [about page](/company/) and at the [product handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/)
to get started.

### Moving to and moving from

The career paths to and from product management positions are varied, but there are some common patterns.

#### Moving to Product Management

Successful product managers have a passion for solving problems. As a result they've
been found to start their journey to product management from the following disciplines:

* **Engineering**: Engineers understand deeply how the product is built and how they work. A desire to understand the user problem of their product 
and to further influence product direction can lead engineers to pursue Product Management roles.
* **UX**: Product Designers and UX leaders have built a great understanding of the personas and pain points their product
targets. A desire to further influence not just the experience but the way the features alleviate those
pain points can draw UX professionals to Product Management.
* **Engineering Manager**: Engineering team leaders who've gained a strong understanding of the customer persona, pain
points and direction of a product often want to further influence that direction by transitioning to Product Management roles.
* **QA/QE**: Quality engineers are responsible for the validation of a product and service. Those who
have a passion for understanding and testing how products are used in the real world by real users often
find a strong alignment to the Product Management function.
* **Product Marketing**: Product Marketers with a desire to have more influence in shaping the product often
migrate to the Product Management function.
* **Customer Success**: Customer facing functions like Solutions Architects, Technical Account Managers, and
lead Support techs who've developed a strong understanding of customers' needs in the product often transition
to Product Management out of a desire to shape the direction of the product.

#### Moving from Product Management

Within their role, Product Managers are empowered to interact and learn more about functions they are interested in.
Whether that be Marketing, Customer Success, Support, Finance or Engineering - Product Managers are encouraged (and often
required) to understand other functions as part of their daily responsibilities. As such there is plenty of room for
Product Managers to transition to roles outside of the Product Management team. Some of those include:
* **Engineering Leadership**: Product Managers often find a desire to dive deeper into Engineering problems, or grow
mentor and lead engineering teams.
* **Product Marketing**: Product Managers often gravitate to how we target, message and deliver value to our customers.
Product Marketing roles are an excellent way to further that expertise.
* **Customer Success**: Few people know our products as well as Product Managers, and product managers who enjoy directly
solving customers problems on a daily basis make great fits for Customer Success roles.
* **General Management**: As a result of their exposure to a wide variety of functions, Product Managers often make a
transition from Product Management to General Management.
