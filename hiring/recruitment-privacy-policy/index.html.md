* Internally with GitLab team members, contractors, and vendors who require the information to administer and manage the recruitment process;
* To third-party service providers which process personal information on our behalf to provide certain services, such as background checks;

* We may share your personal information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas, warrants) or protect the rights, property, or safety, of GitLab, our employees, or users;
* If GitLab is acquired or transferred (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we may share your personal information with the acquiring or receiving entity. 

#### Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we collect and process your personal information on the following legal bases set out by applicable law:

*Consent:* We may ask you for your consent to process your personal information. You can withdraw your consent at any time, which will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. 

*Legitimate Interest:* We process certain personal information for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include, for example, administering the recruitment process and managing applicants effectively.

*Performance of a Contract:* We process personal information to perform steps that are necessary prior to entering an employment contract with you, where you are considered for employment.'

*Compliance with Legal Obligations:* In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal information, such as to meet our legal requirements or in response to a court or regulatory order. We also may need to process your personal information to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.

#### International Data Transfer

Your personal information may be processed in the United States, the country where you have applied for a job, or any other country where GitLab or its subcontractors have team members or operations.

GitLab may transfer, store, or process your personal information in a country outside your jurisdiction, including countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. If we transfer personal information from the EEA, Switzerland, or United Kingdom to a country outside it, such as the United States, we will enter into EU standard contractual clauses with the data importer, or take other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection.

#### Security

Access to your personal information is controlled and GitLab maintains a comprehensive information security program using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. 

#### Data Retention

Your personal information will be retained until the end of the employment application process plus a reasonable period thereafter. If your job application is successful, the personal information collected during the recruitment process will be added to your human resources file and retained for the duration of your employment.

#### Your Rights and Choices

You may access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time. You may also withdraw your consent, or object to the processing of your personal information when based on our legitimate interests. To do so, please contact us at: `recruiting@gitlab.com`.    

Due to a high volume of Candidates, GitLab uses automated decision-making to filter Candidates based on responses to our application questions.  When certain criteria is met regarding visa sponsorship, work permits, hiring country, and other employment restrictions, our software will reject your application.  This is because GitLab cannot legally hire or sponsor workers in a number of jurisdictions, or in certain cases other legal requirements are in place that prevent hiring. We will continually update which responses will result in a rejection of your application as our legal requirements change.  Once rejected, your application will not move forward in our recruitment process.

Our use of automated decision-making enables us to enter into an employment contract with the selected Candidate by providing a manageable list of possible candidates.  If you object to our use of automated decision-making for the reasons stated above, please contact us at `recruitingops@gitlab.com` to request a separate review of your application by one of our trained recruitment specialists.  After this separate review, we will contact you with an explanation of our decision.

#### Policy Changes

GitLab may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to make a significant change to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of the update on this site. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information.

#### Contact Information

If you have questions or concerns about the way we are handling your information, please email us with the subject line "Privacy Concern" at `DPO@gitlab.com`.

The controller of your personal information is the GitLab affiliate who is hiring.
