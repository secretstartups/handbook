### Project Access

The Recruiting Operations and Insights team audits users and access level permissions of the Recruiting group on a monthly basis.

----
### Reporting

To note: When preparing reports, please be mindful that **not** all roles are subject to a `Location Factor`. However, despite a role **not** being subject to one, we will still report it. The reason being is to have a comprehensive view of `Location Factors` in our hiring efforts. To accommodate this, two averages will be calculated; one of the overall average that **includes** all roles and another that **excludes** the roles where it is not applicable. 

Please see the list below of roles where `Location Factor` is **not** applicable:

* **Instructions**: Refresh the [Base] sheets, which are linked to Greenhouse via their *Google Sheets Connector*.

Filter the sheet by the `Converted to Candidate` column - remove "0" - then sort the sheet alphabetically by the `Prospect Pool` column. Combine all duplicates so that only aggregated pool information remains. Calculate the *Conversion Rate* (Converted to Candidate/Prospects in Pool/Stages) and use that information to update the `Historical Metrics` and `Pool Metrics` tabs. Secondly, copy the data from the `[Base] Prospecting Activity` sheet and paste that into the `prospecting_activity_data` sheet, matching the existing columns. Next, assign a *Role* to Recruiting Team Members **only** (e.g. *Recruiting Manager*, *Recruiter*, or *Sourcer*). Remove all "Blanks" from the `Role` column and calculate the *Conversion Rate* (Converted to Candidate/Prospects Added). Reference that range when updating the chart on the `Historical Metrics` tab.

  Sourcing Metrics
  </summary>

* **System**: Greenhouse
* **Instructions**: This report is a complilation of multiple linked reports via the *Greenhouse Report Connector* tool. Refresh all reports via that connector and enter the current monthly data into the appropriate columns in the following tabs: `Source (Month/Month)`, `Sources & Percentages`, and `Quality (Month/Month)`. Please see the list below for additional action items, where applicable.
     * `Source (Month/Month)`: Simply update the appropriate values that correspond to each source.
         * If a new source needs to be added, insert a new row in the appropriate **Source Category** (e.g. *Prospecting*) and enter its values.
         * Given the current Outbound model, there should be **no** candidates with the source, `Jobs page on your website`. If there are, please take the following steps to audit their source:
             1. Run the [New Candidates by Source](https://gitlab.greenhouse.io/reports/new_candidates_by_source?term=&job_status=all&user_role_on_jobs=any_role&include_template_jobs=0&date_relative=current_month&summarize=month&include_migrated_candidates=1&hide_empty_rows=false) report (Filters: `Job Status = All`; `Date = Current Month`; [X] Include Migrated Candidates)
             1. Go to the **All Candidates** tab and set the following filters:
                 * **Clear** the default filters (`Active` and `Open Jobs`)
                 * Apply `Source = Jobs page on your website` 
                 * Apply `Applied On = [Current Month]`
                 * For each candidate that appears, check their respective *Activity Feeds* to see how they came to be in their current requisition.
                     * For example, if a Recruiting Team Member moved the candidate to the current requisition, then the candidate's source should likely be `Greenhouse Sourcing`.
     * `Sources & Percentages`: Update the appropriate values that correspond to each source. Then, referencing the *Hiring Speed per Candidate* report, determine the total number of **Outbound Offer Accepts** and the **Total Offer Accepts**. The percentage will update automatically as well as the charts if the month remains the same.
         * When adding a new month, create two new columns, copying their formatting, and update the chart's range.
     * `Quality (Month/Month)`: Simply update the appropriate values that correspond to each source.
