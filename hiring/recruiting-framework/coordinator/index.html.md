## Candidate Experience Specialist Responsibilities
{: #framework-coord}

The CES team operates off of a queue style system with differing levels of priorities based on the request.  The CES team utilizes [GitLab Service Desk](/product/service-desk/) to track all incoming requests to the CES team.


### Best Practices

- The CES team focuses their attention on incoming requests in the following order: CES Service Desk, individual emails, `@ces` slack pings, and lastly slack direct messages. 
- You can find the priority list based on the type of request below:
   - 0 - Contracts
   - 1 - Reference & Background checks
   - 2 - Candidate emails
   - 3 - Reschedules
   - 4 - Schedule Interviews
- The CES team now utilizes a new program called [Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/coordinator/#using-the-candidate-guide) to enhance the candidate experience and create a more transparent view into the recruiting processes. One of the features of the Guide is that each Greenhouse stage has a corresponding template that is automatically updated meaning that if a candidate is moved to References or Offer they will see that they are in that stage. Due to this feature, the team needs to be very conscious of when they are moving candidates inbetween stages. 

#### How the CES Team will run the Service Desk

1. Under this [CES Service Desk Project](https://gitlab.com/gl-recruiting/ces-service-desk) set up the proper notifications
   - Click on the bell icon on the top right next to Star and Clone
   - Go to Custom Settings
   - Check "New issue"
   - Closeout the window
1. On the left-side menu bar click Issues
   - This is where all our incoming CES emails will create an issue. You'll get an alert when someone sends an email to the CES email alias. Any "emails" that need to be addressed will be an open issue listed within this project.
1. Each CES will begin their workday by triaging issues within the Service Desk based on the [identified priority list](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/coordinator/#best-practices) by adding the appropriate label to the issue and then will begin working on Level 0 priority requests and so on.
   1. Click on the new Issue
   1. Assign it to yourself on the right-side toolbar
   1. Read the Issue message
   1. Respond to the "email" by adding comments to the issue (be sure to enter comments as you would an email to the candidate)
   1. If this one comment address the entire message and the Application Tracking System (ATS) is the tool needed, add a comment and close the issue

### Req Creation

- The CES team needs to be notified once a req is approved for recruiting 
- The Recruiter will open a req kick off issue template 
   - A kick off isssue is required for all roles which includes evergreen positions
   - The kick off issue will be the SSOT for documentation regarding all CES tasks required to open a new req
- Internal only roles need to have "Current Team Members Only" on the req name  
   - CES will then know to not add the role to the static site and the rest of the conpany will know that we do not accept referrals for it
- Every kick off call will have the entire CES team invited and the team will have a rotation on which specialist will attend

### Screening

- Once a candidate is moved into the Screening stage, the Sourcer is to send the GSIS
- When scheduling a candidate for a screening call with a recruiter, the calendly link is to be used. We will no longer use the "Request Availability" option for screening calls as this creates unnecessary manual work  
   - If the candidate is sourced, the sourcer should send the calendly
   - If it's an agency candidate or a referral where the recruiter may see the candidate first, the recruiter should send their calendly link

### Team Interviews

- When a candidate is ready to team interview interviews scheduled, the recruiter will ping `@ces` in the Greenhouse profile with next steps
   - If there are shorter timelines for roles as defined by the hiring team, CES needs to be made aware of those timelines for when interviews need to be scheduled. We will default to scheduling interviews at a minimum of [48 hours](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#moving-candidates-through-the-process) out to leave time for interviewer prep.
   - Reminder: When tagging `@ces` in Greenhouse, do not tag anyone other than the team in the same ping as it will add those users to the service desk project.
- The CES will request availability via Greenhouse
   - CES will set a reminder to follow up regarding availability if not received within the next 48 hours 
   - CES will then set another reminder to follow up 24 hours after the initial 48 hour email 
   - After the 3rd email to candidate with no response, the CES will make the Recruiter aware of the no response 
   - Note: Greenhouse reminders should be set for "Coordinator" not a specific person
- After availability is received, CES will schedule interviews based on the interview plans in Greenhouse   
   - CES will be using the Zoom integration with Greenhouse for interviews
- If the candidate is an internal candidate, the CES will tag Recruiting Ops and Insights in the GH profile to merge while candidate is still in the Team Interview stage. 
- CES will [send interview confirmations via Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/coordinator/#using-the-candidate-guide)
- CES will not automatically schedule next interviews based off of scorecards 
   - The Recruiter or Hiring Manager will need to tag `@ces` in Greenhouse with communication about specific next steps
   - Any candidates who receive a no or definitely not scorecard should be discussed with the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager before declining.

#### Executive Interview Scheduling

For Directors and above with Executive Business Admins:

   1. Prior to candidates moving to the Executive interview stage the Candidate Experience Specialist (CES) ensures the candidate's profile contains a resume/cv,  contact phone number and feedback from prior interviews.
   1. The CES then moves the candidate to Executive Stage in Greenhouse (if applicable)
   1. The CES requests availability from the candidate.
   1. Once the availability is back from the candidate the CES will ping [the appropriate Executive Business Admin (EBA)](/handbook/eba/#executive-business-administrator-team) in the Greenhouse notes section and will include any relevant details such as internal, timezone or high priority.
   1. The EBA will schedule the interview using a unique zoom link, generated by the EBA, and will send out the interview confirmation email to the candidate with a cc to the candidate's CES.
       * For the EVPE, all interviews should be scheduled for 60 minutes, the EBA will not use "speedy meetings" for EVPE's interviews.
   1. If the EBA is unable to find a suitable time within the candidate's given availability the EBA should suggest times that will work, see the next section for details.

For the VP of Alliances, VP of Commercial Sales, VP of Customer Success, VP of Enterprise Sales, VP of Field Operations and the VP of Worldwide Channels:

   1. Prior to candidates moving to the Executive interview stage the Candidate Experience Specialist (CES) ensures the candidate's profile contains a resume/cv,  contact phone number and feedback from prior interviews.
   1. The CES then moves the candidate to Executive Stage in Greenhouse (if applicable).
   1. The CES pings [the appropriate Executive Business Admin (EBA)](/handbook/eba/#executive-business-administrator-team) in the Greenhouse notes section requesting interview options and will include any relevant details such as internal, timezone or high priority.
   1. The EBA will @ mention the CES in the Greenhouse note section with approximately 3 interview options and specify the timezone the options are given in.
   1. The CES sends the candidate the suggested times using the Candidate Availability for Executive Interviews email template.
   1. After the Candidate responds indicating the time that works for them the CES schedules the interview and uses the interviewer's personal zoom link.
   1. The CES sends the interview confirmation email with a cc to the EBA.

If you have any questions about the process, please post in #eba-team slack channel and @ mention the EBA to the CEO.

### Reference Checks/Background Checks

GitLab will obtain references and complete a criminal [background check](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-policy-directory/#background-checks) with employment verifications.

- Once a candidate is moved to the reference check and background check stage, the recruiter should ping `@ces` to kick off the process
   - The CES team will default to kicking off both unless specified otherwise to only collect references
- CES will send the References and Background Check email via Guide
- CES will send [references to hiring managers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/hiring-manager/#step-19hm-complete-references) with recruiter in cc via email utilizing the "Email the Team" option in GH once received from the candidate. Please ensure this email is sent from the CES team.
- The Candidate Experience Specialist will [initiate a background check](/handbook/people-group/people-policy-directory/#background-checks) for the candidate. CES will continue to monitor the background check until finalized, utlizing the follow-up feature in Greenhouse to ensure the background check is complete and uploaded into BambooHR, if hired
- Background check results will be received by the Candidate Experience Specialist and brought to the relevant People Business Partner for adjudication 
- Employment Verification results will be reviewed by and checked against LinkedIn profiles or CVs by the Candidate Experience Specialist and any discrepancies will brought to the relevant People Business Partner

### Speaking with TMRG members in the hiring process

Our hiring process includes an **optional** step where candidates can request to meet with an TMRG team member. Candidates can request this at any time throughout the process, we will also proactively offer this to a candidate when they reach the reference check stage. Whether or not the candidate decides to take us up on this offer will have no impact on our overall hiring decision.

When a candidate requests to meet with an TMRG team member, their Candidate Experience Specialist will do the following:
1. Share a message in the respective TMRG Slack channel. To aide with scheduling, the message will include the candidate’s time zone and a request for volunteers who would be willing to speak to that person for a 25-minute Zoom call. 
   - Below are the slack channels you can ask for volunteers in  
      - #lgbtq
      - #women
      - #minoritiesintech
      - #diverse_ability
      - #gender-minorities-employee-resource-group
      - #generational_understanding

1. Once a volunteer has been found the Candidate Experience Specialist will send the candidate the 'TMRG Opportunity' email template. The CES will need to get the TMRG members’ Calendly link and GitLab team page profile.

1. If a volunteer has not been found within 24 hours the CES team member will reach out to the [TMRG lead(s)](/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/) and request assistance with scheduling. If a volunteer has not been found within 2 business days of the request, the CES will ask the TMRG lead to take part in the conversation.

As a GitLab team member taking part in these calls, we advise you to start with a short introduction to you and your role here at GitLab. From here, we advise you to let the candidate lead the conversation as the goal is for you to answer their questions and offer insight into how we work.

These calls don’t require you to submit a scorecard in Greenhouse. If a candidate mentions something that you see as a red flag (e.g. they outline a past action of theirs that goes against our values) or share something that would help us set them up for success, we advise you to share the details of this with the hiring manager for the role they’re interviewing for. It will be the responsibility of the Hiring Manager to review this and decide whether we need to alter the hiring or offer process for the candidate.


### Send contract

[See Candidate Experience Specialist Contract Processes section of the handbook](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/ces-contract-processes)

The [Candidate Experience Specialists](/job-families/people-ops/candidate-experience/)) will prepare the contract. While the Candidate Experience Specialist will prioritize a contract above other tasks, the expected turn around on the task is 1 business day. If the contract is time-sensitive, please provide context for the rush. If the Candidate Experience Specialist cannot meet the 1 business day they will inform the recruiter via Greenhouse and will provide context.

Recruiters should make themselves familiar with the basic knowledge of the contract processes that can be found on the [CES Contract Processes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/ces-contract-processes/#framework-coord) page and the [Contracts and International Expansion](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/contracts-and-international-expansion/#employee-contractor-agreements) page.

   1. Check all aspects of the offer:
      - Do we have the new team members' legal name in their profile?

_It is extremely important to enter the team member's full legal name (as much as it is known before visually seeing a legal ID). Full legal name is usually provided for the [background check](/handbook/people-group/people-policy-directory/#background-checks) process. It is important to be as accurate as possible, including the person's full legal name as well as any accents used for their name. This reiterates our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging values and also prevents audit fails down the line when the [People Experience Associates](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/people-ops/people-experience-associate/) onboard the team member, and the [People Compliance Specialist](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/people-ops/people-compliance/) audits all personal data._

      - Is the new team members' address listed on the details page?
      - What contract type and entity are required based upon location and offer details?
      - Is it clear how many (if any) stock options this person should receive?
      - Is all necessary information (start date, salary, location, etc.) up to date?
      - Does the new team member need a work permit or visa, or require an update to them before a start date can be agreed?
      - Has the signatory been determined by the Candidate Experience Specialist and updated?
      - Has the Entity been selected based on the New Hire's location?
   1. [Generate the contract within Greenhouse](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/ces-contract-processes) using a template based on the details found in the offer package.
   1. Contact the recruiter or new team member to gather any missing pieces of information (note: the address can be found on the background check information page).
   1. The Signatory will be either the Recruiting Manager, VP of Recruiting, Chief People Officer, or the CES for PEOs. This can be determinted by the Candidate Expereince Specialist sending a message to the Contracts to Sign channel in Slack.
   1. The entity will be selected based on the new hire's location.
   1. Ensure that, if the contract was created outside of Greenhouse, the contract has been reviewed and approved by the Senior Director of Legal Affairs or a Total Rewards Analyst.
   1. [Stage the contract in DocuSign from within Greenhouse](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/ces-contract-processes), which emails the contract to the signing parties, with the recruiter, recruiting manager, and the hiring manager cc'd. It will be sent to the designated signatory as previously determined in Offer Details.
   1. When the contract is signed by all parties, the Candidate Experience Specialist will verify that the start date in Greenhouse is correct.
     - Ensure the candidate has completed the PIAA section with either a `Yes` and the specific details **or** `None`. (Its important that it is not just a GitLab or Github link and more specific info.) 
     - If the candidate has specified a `Yes` and the specific details, make the People Experience team aware in our private group slack channel to kick off approval process.
   1. **Before marking the candidate as hired** the Candidate Experience Specialist will reject the candidate from any other active roles including roles for which they are a prospect (without sending a rejection email). _NOTE: If this step is skipped, the profile will not be exported to Bamboo HR when the candidate is marked as hired._ 
   1. **Before marking the candidate as hired** the CES will ping the recruiter and give them 24 hours to contact/reject all other active candidates. Once this is complete, the CES can proceed with hiring in GH. 
   1. **Before marking the candidate as hired** the CES will verify if the listed Recruiter and Coordinator in the `Details` >  `Source & Responsibility` section of the candidate's profile is correct to ensure accuracy in reporting.
   1. The CES will mark the candidate as "Hired" in Greenhouse: _when prompted, select the option to close the req._ Please note, the new hire's BambooHR profile will be generated automatically by the [Greenhouse to BambooHR sync](/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/) that runs every 15 minutes.
   1. Once the new hire's profile in BambooHR is generated, The Candidate Experience Specialist will upload the signed contract and the completed background check into the BambooHR profile.
   1. The Candidate Experience Specialist will send an email to total-rewards@gitlab with any variations in contract language (for example a draw). Compensation will sync with Payroll and Sales Ops for any necessary notifications on payment types.
   1. The Candidate Experience Specialist will email the new team member the Welcome Email from Greenhouse with a cc to IT Ops.  For new team members in USA, use 'GitLab Welcome - US only' template.  For team members located outside the US, use 'GitLab Welcome - non US' template
      * Instructions on the [Notebook Ordering Process](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) are included with this email.
   1. Should the start date change after the welcome email is sent please see the required steps [here](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-framework/ces-contract-processes/#how-to-update-a-start-date-after-the-contract-is-signed).
   1. Exception to the start date and onboarding date alignment: If a new team member requires a specific start date for legal reasons (cannot have break in employment) but the People Experience Team cannot start onboarding on that specific day (because of Public Holiday), the Candidate Experience Specialist can notify the People Experience team in the private Slack channel `people-exp_ces`. The Contract, Greenhouse and BambooHR should reflect the same start date regardless of the actual onboarding date.  

It is **important** that the Candidate Experience Specialist notifies the People Experience Team of any important changes regarding the new team member, which also ensures the new team members are handed off properly to the People Experience Team.

### How to Unhire a Candidate After Contract is Signed
If for some reason a candidate declines an offer after they have been hired into the system, whoever receives that information needs to make sure `@ces` is tagged in the Greenhouse profile and is made aware that the candidate will no longer be starting at GitLab. 

If they have been hired in Greenhouse and exported to BambooHR, follow these steps:
1. Unhire the candidate in Greenhouse.
1. Reject them in Greenhouse; add reasons in notes, you may add the email that was sent by the candidate. Click ‘reject and don’t send email’.
1. Cancel any scheduled emails in Greenhouse.
1. Tag the Senior Director, People Success in the `#people-group-confidential` Slack channel and ask to remove the profile from BambooHR and @ mention the @people-exp team for visibility. Only a BambooHR owner (at GitLab this is the Senior Director, People Success) can remove the profile, this is why this step is so important. 
1.  If they were hired via a PEO, inform the contact person of this change immediately, ideally before onboarding starts.

### Mid-Point Check-In Follow up

The Candidate Experience Specialist will set up a delay send email using the "GitLab Helpful Links - Checking In" email template in GreenHouse. The delay should be set up for halfway between the contract being signed and the start date.
   1. Navigate to the Candidate's profile in GreenHouse.
   1. Under Tools Email Candidate
   1. From the Template drop-down select: GitLab Helpful Links - Checking In
   1. From the Send email when drop-down select: Pick a custom time...
   1. From the calendar select a future date and time, halfway between now and the Candidate's start date.
   1. Check Schedule Email.

If necessary you may cancel the email, which is now showing under the Email Candidate option.

### Next Steps

People Experience Associate will create the onboarding issue and start the [onboarding tasks](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/) no later than one week before the new team member joins. Should a contract not be signed prior to 4 working days from the start date, a new start date will be required.

For questions about the new team member's onboarding status, you can @mention them in the `#peopleops-confidential` Slack channel.

For questions about the new team member's laptop, ping [IT Ops](#it-ops) in Slack. If the questions arise through email, forward the email to itops@gitlab.com and ping IT Ops in #it-ops Slack, and @it-ops-team too due to volume.

### Interview Reimbursement Process

For candidates requesting [interview reimbursment](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#reimbursement-for-interviewing-with-gitlab) the CES team will partner with the Account Payable (AP) team to ensure requests are processed confidentially and in a timely manner. AP and the CES team utilize [GitLab Service Desk](/product/service-desk/) to track incoming emails to the Interviews@gitlab.com email.

Under the [Interview Reimbursement Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/interview-reimbursement/ap-ces/issues) set up the proper notifications
   - Click on the bell icon on the top right next to Star and Clone
   - Go to Custom Settings
   - Check "New issue"
   - Closeout the window

Additional process details can be found on the [project README page](https://gitlab.com/interview-reimbursement/ap-ces/blob/master/README.md).
