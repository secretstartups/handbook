## Career development

### Within the TAM job family
- The [TAM Job Family page](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/technical-account-manager/) is kept updated with the roles and responsibilities of each level within the TAM job family
- The [TAM Skills Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UEke64Qkz8wSyqfr_E9qqeAF6rX77w4vIH84Ckm_ts/edit#gid=0) enables a TAM to determine areas of opportunity in working towards their next level of seniority


### Within the CS org
- [The SA Job Family page](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/solutions-architect/) is kept update with the roles, responsibilities and technical expectations of an SA. For TAMs interested in moving into SA roles, they can work with their managers on learning paths to develop the technical and sales skills where needed.

### Within GitLab, outside of CS
- While there is no 'formula' for moving into roles in other teams, we welcome TAM growth and desire to explore alternative areas with GitLab.  For TAMs looking to move into different groups outside of CS, the first step is to review the job family requirements and connect with their manager on determining a path. It is encouraged for managers to connect with the group's team leaders in question to build out a development plan that will have the best chances of success.
