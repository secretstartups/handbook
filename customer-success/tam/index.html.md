## What is a Technical Account Manager (TAM)?

GitLab's Technical Account Managers serve as trusted advisors to GitLab customers. They offer guidance, planning, and oversight during the technical deployment and implementation process. They fill a unique space in the overall service lifecycle and customer journey and actively bind together sales, solution architects, customer stakeholders, product management, Professional Services Engineers and support.

See the [Technical Account Manager role description](/job-families/sales/technical-account-manager/) for further information.

### Advocacy

A Technical Account Manager is an advocate for both the customer and GitLab. They act on behalf of customers serving as a feedback channel to development and shaping of the product. In good balance, they also advocate on behalf of GitLab to champion capabilities and features that will improve quality, increase efficiency and realize new value for our customer base.

#### Management

Technical Account Managers maintain the relationships between the customers and GitLab. Making sure that everyone is working towards pre-defined goals and objectives.

#### Growth

Technical Account Managers help to bring GitLab to all aspects of your company, not just software development. They can do this by showing other business units how to use GitLab for their day-to-day tasks and to advocate for new features and functionality that are in demand by other groups.

#### Success

Technical Account Managers make sure that the adoption of GitLab is successful at your company through planning, implementation, adoption, and training.

Your TAM can help you:

- Create a roadmap for your development cycle.
- Deliver training to your users through webinars and other deep-dive sessions.
- Analyze your data to suggest changes, additions, and improvements to optimize your workflow.

To get the most out of your TAM relationship:

- **Stay in touch with your TAM**. Set up a group in your organization to attend webinars and regular meetings.
- **Make a plan**. Get help building your roadmap to guide your progress.
- **Set a schedule**. Set up regular meetings to review your progress and improve your planning, including bi-annual meetings and reviews.
- **Know your backup**. When your TAM is unavailable, you'll have a backup who can step in to help.

## Responsibilities and Services

#### Book of Business

Technical Account Managers are responsible for managing a portfolio of customer accounts based on the sum of the annual contract value of the accounts under management. The current target per TAM for the [TAM-assigned segment](/handbook/customer-success/tam/customer-segments-and-metrics/#tam-assigned-segment) is 3.6M per TAM

The team continues to drive efficiency improvements to allow TAMs to effectively manage a larger book of business.

## SFDC useful reports 

### Tracking oportunities for your assigned SALs

To ensure that opportunities are listed with the correct Order Type, [this Salesforce report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004agfP) shows you all of the opportunities that have closed, or are soon to close, with your SALs. Tracking Order Type is important since TAM team quota and compensation depend on this. Please reference the latest [Sales Compensation Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/sales-comp-plan/) information to know what is counted.

Next steps for you:

1. Customize [this SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004agfP) where “Account Owner = your SALs”; “TAM = You”
1. Save report
1. Subscribe to report when “Record Count Greater Than 0” and Frequency = Weekly (You’ll get a weekly email as a reminder to look at the report)
1. If you find an opp that is tagged incorrectly, chatter (@Sales-Support) in the opportunity and let them know there is a mistake ([example(https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/tam/#tam-tools)])
