## TAM Alignment

Customers who meet the following criteria are aligned with a Technical Account Manager.  *These criteria are reviewed annually and are subject to change*:

### Enterprise

- [Meets Enterprise Segment Criteria](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#segmentation)
- Recurring contract value (ARR) of $50,000 or greater
- Exceptions can be made for clearly defined growth opportunities, decided by sales and TAM leadership

#### Parent-Child Accounts and Business Units

It's not uncommon for a single customer to have different subsidiaries or [business units](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#business-unit) with their own GitLab instances and contracts. In effect, each of these separate entities behaves as a separate customer from the perspective of the TAM - different points of contact, different initiatives, different strategic outcomes.

When evaluating whether a customer is TAM qualifying, we consider the size of the [business unit](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#business-unit), not the total ARR of a given customer, nor the total ARR of a parent account and all of their combined child accounts.

Example:

- `Customer A` has $50k ARR spread across three separate [business units](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#business-unit) spending $22k, $17k, and $10k respectively. None of those is TAM qualifying.
- `Customer B` has $60k ARR spread across two [business units](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#business-unit) spending $53k and $7k respectively. The [business unit](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#business-unit) spending $53k is TAM qualifying, but the other is not.

### Commercial

- Commercial (Mid-Market and SMB) customers are eligible for a TAM if the recurring contract value (ARR) is greater than $50,000.
- APAC accounts should be routed through the APAC TAM manager for assignment
- Exceptions can be made for clearly defined growth opportunities, decided by sales and TAM leadership. The basic criteria used will be (1 AND 2 AND 3):
    1. Well defined growth opportunity
    1. Clear objectives/goals - what do they need TAM help to accomplish?
    1. Timeframe - if we accomplish X and Y in Z months, we agree to evaluate expanding/growing
- [Commercial TAM group direction](/handbook/customer-success/tam/commercial/vision/)
