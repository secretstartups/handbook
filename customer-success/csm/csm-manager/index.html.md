## Review Processes

Below are some of the top processes to be performed by CSM Managers on a recurring cadence. The overall goal is to ensure the CSM Manager has a strong grasp on their team's group of customers through various data points (health, Support tickets, Onboarding objects, renewals, etc.). Resources such as Dashboards and videos are included for easy reference.

### Review Checklist

For CSM Managers, here is a short checklist to assist in the review:

- [Account assignment:](#account-assignment) Accounts have been reviewed and are assigned or are in review
- [Customer Onboarding:](#customer-onboarding-review) Customers in the Onboarding phase have been reviewed and onboarding status and notes are complete
- [Success Plans:](#success-plan-review) Customers have a Success Plan, it is being communicated with the customer, and the CSM is using it as the guiding document
- [At-Risk Customers:](#health-review-and-at-risk-customers) Health for all CSM-assigned accounts have been updated within the last month, and any accounts at-risk (Red, Yellow trending down) are being evaluated
- [Renewal Review:](#renewal-review) Upcoming customer renewals have been reviewed — the CSM has updated customer health and communicated with the SAE and SA for the upcoming renewal

### Account Assignment

Accounts are assigned at point of sale by the CSM Manager when a new Account in their region fits the criteria in [CSM Responsibilities and Services](/handbook/customer-success/csm/services/#csm-alignment).

When an Account meets the criteria, the following will happen:

- The CSM Manager assigns the CSM by populating the `CSM Name` field on the C360 account page in Gainsight (only managers have the ability to edit this field)
- Once the field has been updated with the CSM name, Gainsight will fire the onboarding playbook
- **If** the account meets the above criteria and the CSM is not assigned, Gainsight will fire a CTA (call to action) for the CSM manager asking them to assign the account.  Gainsight will then 'listen' for the CSM field to be populated and will fire the onboarding playbook once the field has been updated with the CSM name

While the SAE owns the transition-to-CSM aspect, the CSM Manager will then ensure the new account is assigned to a CSM and Onboarding has commenced.

#### Assignment Resources

- [Onboarding Handbook](/handbook/customer-success/csm/onboarding/)
- Gainsight Dashboard - **CS Leadership**

### Customer Onboarding Review

On a regular basis, the CSM Manager should review their team's active Onboarding plays. The Onboarding plays can be reviewed with each individual in one-on-one meetings. Onboarding is measured by the [time to value metrics](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#time-to-value-kpis). Consider:

1. How many and which accounts are in onboarding?
2. What do Time to Value metrics look like? 
3. After looking at the detail, what are areas we want to improve and areas to celebrate?

#### Onboarding Resources

- [Account Onboarding Handbook](/handbook/customer-success/csm/onboarding/)
- Gainsight Dashboard - **CSM Portfolio** or **Customer Onboarding**

#### KPI Tracking in Gainsight

</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

- **Time to engagement** is calculated by the addition of a timeline entry or type Cadence Call or Meeting.
- **Time to first value** uses license utilisation as a proxy for users actively using the platform with a threshold of 10%
  - Automatically calculated when Cloud Licensing turned on (*Note:* If Cloud Licensing is not enabled from the outset, this automation can cause invalid outliers, in this scenario manually correct)
  - Manually collected by the CSM in collaboration with the customer when License data isn't available
- **Time to onboard** is calculated by onboarding enablement complete *not* infrastructure ready

### Success Plan Review

On a regular basis the CSM Manager should review their team's [Success Plans](/handbook/customer-success/csm/success-plans/). At a minimum, the review should include:

1. What is the customer's documented strategy and is that aligned to why they bought?
1. Are all parties (SAE/AE, SA, CSM, customer) aligned on the stated goals?
1. If the objectives are met, are they in the customer's best interest?
1. Are the outcomes measurable (either as a deliverable or quantifiable)?
1. Is the customer on track to meet or exceed their business outcomes?
1. Are the next steps for demonstrating value defined and in place?

The CSM Manager should then work with their team to help the CSM drive up and demonstrate value to the customer.

- Gainsight Dashboard - **CSM Portfolio** or **CS Leadership**


### Health Review and At-Risk Customers

On at least a monthly basis, review accounts within your region in preparation for a biweekly **At-Risk** call. This includes reviewing:

1. Gainsight dashboards for unhealthy accounts
   1. SFDC Reports on red accounts
   1. Gainsight at-risk comments per account 

Details for all at-risk account should be captured in Gainsight using an `At-Risk Update` timeline entry. These updates are synced to Salesforce, and reports used to review at-risk accounts draw on these updates.

#### At-Risk Resources

Generally triage commentary now is recorded by the CSM/Manager in the account timeline in Gainsight, however the CSM may create a Triage issue for broader collaboration across the account team:
- Gainsight Dashboard - **CSM Portfolio** or **CS Leadership**
- [Account Triage Handbook](/handbook/customer-success/csm/health-score-triage/)
- [Account Triage Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/account-triage/-/boards/703769)


#### At-Risk Review Meetings

At-risk customer meetings are conducted on a regular basis across regions and at a global level. The table below provides an overview of the different meetings conducted.

| Region/Territory | Cadence | Roles |
|---|---|---|
| Global CSM | Weekly; alternating biweekly for EMEA and APAC friendly times | VP of Customer Success, VP of CSMs, CSM Regional Directors and/or Managers, Director of Renewals |
| AMER ENT West | Biweekly | CSM: Director, Managers; Sales: AVP, ASMs |
| AMER ENT East | Biweekly | CSM: Director, Managers; Sales: AVP, ASMs |
| AMER COM  | Weekly | CSM: Director, Managers; Sales: AVP, ASMs |
| EMEA COM  | Weekly | CSM: Director, Managers; Sales: AVP, ASMs |
| APAC  | Bi-Weekly | CSM: Manager; Sales: AVP, ENT & COM ASMs |
| Public Sector | Biweekly | VP of Customer Success, VP of Public Sector, Director of Customer Success, ASMs, CSM and Renewals Team Managers |

### Renewal Review

At least twice-monthly the CSM Manager should review their region's dashboard for upcoming renewals and review questions such as:

1. Which renewals are coming this quarter?
1. Which renewals are coming in the next 2-3 quarters?
1. What is the health of the accounts?
1. Is the health of each account up to date?
1. Based on this analysis, what are my next steps for the customer's success and our Gross and Net Retention goals?

The CSM Manager should then work with their CSM to ensure collaboration with the GitLab team (SAE/AE, SA, and CSM) for a successful renewal.

## Quarterly Business Review (QBR)

The CSM Manager is responsible for developing and delivering a [Quarterly Business Review](/handbook/sales/qbrs/) for their team each quarter.

1st week:
1. KPIs: nARR, renewal rate (async)
1. Team: Hiring, Career Dev, Risk
1. Customers: Escalations & Risk. SFDC Report: **At-Risk Customers**

## Annual Processes

### President's Club Calculations

The following process is that used to calculate the President's Club Performance (FY24): 

CSM must have been in a commissionable role since beginning of Q3

#### CSM Nomination Criteria (equally weighted):

1. % of Accounts with manager-validated Green Success Plans (Based on accounts >30 days from onboarding start date)
1. % per CSM attainment to targets laid out in FY24 comp. plans: Net ARR & Renewal rate.

#### CSE Nomination Criteria (equally weighted):

1. % attainment of CSE customer calls to target 
1. % per CSE attainment to targets laid out in FY24 comp. plans: Net ARR & Renewal rate.


#### Scoring Process for each of the categories:
1. 1st place in the team: 50 points
1. 2nd place in the team: 35 points
1. 3rd place in the team: 15 points

#### People Manager Criteria:

1. CSM/CS Leadership discretion based on GitLab values, and is at the discretion of CS leadership.

#### Conditions:
1. No points for anything following top 3 positions unless there are multiple CSMs with 100% (success plans for example), in which case each CSM scoring 100% would receive 50 points
1. If there are two or more CSMs tying for a position across the other categories, 50 points each for top place
1. In a smaller team, if a CSM scores 0 for any category, they do not get points in simply defaulting to 3rd place - this CSM/s would score 0 and 1st/2nd place would remain at 50/35 points respectively


**Final Tally: Top CSMs per team by points**


## Team Member Performance

Managers have the responsibility of evaluating and providing feedback on team member performance. We have resources available to help with this:

- [Individual FY Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Etn2bCNewGYe6BLv4VmrjuGfEqtxqzUk14f0geTaVBM/edit?usp=sharing): One-sheet outline of the key metrics & criteria for a team member to achieve in a given fiscal year, tailored to the team member. This is best used at the beginning of the fiscal year, assembled by the manager and discussed with the team member. Categories and metrics should be agreed upon by manager and team member, and performance against these reviewed regularly throughout the year.

### Promotion planning

The CSM Manager should provide regular coaching and guidance on where a CSM stands and how to fill any gaps before they are eligible to be promoted. When a CSM is ready for promotion, the CSM Manager should collaborate with the CSM on the [promotion document](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#planning). When building the doc, it is important to lead with the results the CSM has achieved, supported with links to content, issues, MRs, etc.
