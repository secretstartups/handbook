## Sales Plays

The SA should either be included in a discovery call or provided with Outcome / Infrastructure / Challenges  information uncovered by prior interactions with the account.  Occasionally, SA's may support a combination call of discovery and technical demonstration/deep-dive on a single call, but this is suboptimal as the latter approach does not allow the SA time to prepare for and/or tailor the discussion.

The SA is also responsible for any pre-sales technical customer inquiry or audit from associated accounts, including RFI, RFP or security audits. For details on the audit process, proceed to the [Security](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/risk-field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html) page.

The SA is always responsible for drafting Professional Services SOW's, regardless of the account status (pre- and post-sales).

As a general guideline, no more than 2 Solutions Architects should join any single client-facing call, whether it be assistive for the topic or for learning / shadowing.
