* Update the Estimate based upon initial feedback from the Customer and/or Sales team
* Once agreed, generate a supporting Statement of Work (SoW)
* Create a cost estimate (COGS)
* Providing clarification to the PS Director in order to obtain approval for the SoW
* Present the SoW to the account team to gain signature
