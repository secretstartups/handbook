## Team metrics

GitLab Professional Services measures success through tracking business profitability and resource utilization. The targets for FY21 are as follows.

* **Long term profitability target**: 30% gross margin
* **Utilization target**: 70% billable hours

**Utilization**
GitLab Professional Services Engineers track and categorize the utilization of their working hours as either Billable utilization or Productive utilization. 

* **Billable utilization** is time worked on defined scope that will be charged to a customer according to a contractual SOW. 
* **Productive utilization** is time worked on assigned tasks that benefit GitLab and GitLab Customers (overall utilization including marketing, sales, general management, training, internal projects, etc.)

We use the following definitions to determine and track utilization.

 
| Metric | Formula/Description | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Utilization | (Working Hours ÷ Available Hours) × 100% | varies |
| Billable Utilization | (Billable Working Hours ÷ Utilization) × 100% | varies |
| Productive Utilization | (Productive Working Hours ÷ Utilization) × 100% | varies |
| Available Hours | Total Weekday Hours － Non-Working Hours | 1792 hrs |
| Total Weekday Hours | (8 Hours × 5 days × 52 weeks) | 2080 hrs |
| Non-Working Hours | (Holiday Hours + PTO Hours + Training Hours) | 288 hrs |
| Holiday Hours | 11 holidays × 8 hrs/day | 88 hrs |
| PTO Hours | 20 PTO days × 8 hrs/day | 160 hrs |
| Training Hours | 5 professional development days × 8 hrs/day | 40 hrs |

**Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**
This performance indicator measures how satisfied our customers are with their interaction with the GitLab PS team. This is based on survey responses from customers sent at the end of each engagement.  On a scale of 1-5, if the customer submits a 4 or 5, we consider this Customer to be `Satisfied` with the services delivered.
