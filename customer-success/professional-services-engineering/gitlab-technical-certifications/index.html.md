### Why certification?

#### For employers
Team managers now have a way to confirm their team members possess the skills needed to effectively use GitLab in their daily DevOps tasks. This helps ensure the team will be able to successfully adopt GitLab and make the most of the organization's investment.

#### For individuals

Individual GitLab users who earn certification receive a certification logo they can share on social media to showcase their accomplishment. This helps highlight to colleagues and employers their proficiency in effectively using the GitLab platform.

### Recertification

GitLab Technical Certifications do not have an expiration date. Instead, GitLab uses a continuous model for recertification in which a certified individual can take the latest assessments at any time to receive an updated digital badge. The badge provides verification of the latest date certified for an efficient way to showcase staying up-to-date.
