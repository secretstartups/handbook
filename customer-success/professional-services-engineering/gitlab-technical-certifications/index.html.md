## GitLab Technical Certifications

GitLab offers technical certifications to help the GitLab community and team members validate their ability to apply GitLab in their daily DevOps work. To earn certification, candidates must first pass a written assessment, followed by a hands-on lab assessment graded by GitLab Professional Services engineers. 

### Overview

GitLab is planning and developing several technical certifications to help the GitLab community and team members validate their ability to apply GitLab in their daily DevOps work. To earn certification, candidates must first pass a written assessment, followed by a hands-on lab assessment graded by GitLab Professional Services engineers. 

### Why certification?

#### For employers
Team managers now have a way to confirm their team members possess the skills needed to effectively use GitLab in their daily DevOps tasks. This helps ensure the team will be able to successfully adopt GitLab and make the most of the organization's investment.

#### For individuals

Individual GitLab users who earn certification receive a certification logo they can share on social media to showcase their accomplishment. This helps highlight to colleagues and employers their proficiency in effectively using the GitLab platform.

### Currently available certifications

Here are the certifications GitLab has soft-launched in FY'21.
