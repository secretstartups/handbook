description: "How we measure a customer's adoption for general GitLab and different use cases"
---

To drive use case enablement and expansion with customers, we need to define exactly what it means to adopt a use case at GitLab. These health measures will appear in the **Product Usage** scorecard section in Gainsight. For more, see the [Gainsight Scorecard Attributes and Calculations](/handbook/customer-success/tam/health-score-triage/#gainsight-scorecard-attributes-and-calculations).
 

## User Engagement

In addition to license utilization, we need to measure the depth of user engagement and adoption.
Adoption timeline: 6 months after license purchase

|                             | **Red** | **Yellow** | **Green** |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | --------  |
| UMAU / Activated Seat Count | <30%    |      |   |
| UMAU / Licenses Sold        | <30%    |      |   |
| UMAU / Activated Seat Count <br> UMAU / Licenses Sold |     | >=30% AND <br> <50%    |    |
| UMAU / Activated Seat Count <br> UMAU / Licenses Sold |     | <60% AND <br> >=30%    | >=60% AND <br> >=50%   |


## Source Code Management (SCM)

SCM is considered one of the initial land use cases. To that end, we want to ensure the customer is using it appropriately.

|                       | **Red** | **Yellow** | **Green** |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------- | --------  |
| SMAU Create / UMAU    | <50%    |      |     |
| Merge Requests / UMAU | <40%    |      |     |
| SMAU Create / UMAU <BR> Merge Requests / UMAU |     | >=50% AND <BR> <60%     |    |
| SMAU Create / UMAU <BR> Merge Requests / UMAU |     | <75% AND <BR> >=40%     | \>=75% AND <BR> \>=60%    |


## Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is considered both an initial purchase reason or, in the case of SCM, an expansionary use case (one after the initial purchase intent has been solved).

## DevSecOps

For customers on Ultimate, we want to measure their effectiveness and usage with Ultimate-level functionality.
