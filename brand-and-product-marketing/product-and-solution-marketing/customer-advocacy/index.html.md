# Programs we drive and support

**Evergreen customer story creation**

We partner with the content team to run a continual pipeline of customer case studies and blogs. A selection and prioritization process helps us tell the right stories in the right format.

**Customer Advisory Board → Executive Advisory Board**

The advocacy team has traditionally driven what we know as the “customer advisory board” at GitLab. As we evolve in FY24, we’re breaking out our advisory audiences into a Product Customer Advisory Board and an Executive Advisory Board. 

  _For Product CAB questions (now driven by the Product Marketing team) head to #CAB-internal for any questions._

  **Executive Advisory Board (EAB)**

  The EAB is a small, invitation-only cohort of executives from select GitLab customers who are driving business and technology transformation with a visionary DevSecOps strategy. Throughout the annual program, the board will meet both in person and virtually to engage with GitLab leaders, learn innovative best practices from fellow members, and share important insights that help shape the future of GitLab.

**Marquee Videos**

We partner with the brand and design team to deliver one marquee customer story video per quarter. You can find our videos on our [Customer Advocacy spot on Highspot](https://gitlab.highspot.com/spots/636e91aed5e577c7525c583a) or in our [customer stories playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGfElNsQthZG5hdIxVaeLIwGSG6Vw4kb). 

**Press**

We partner closely with the PR team to find the right opportunity to pitch to customers at the right time. We lead with the opportunity that will provide the most value to the customer and will allow for a continued warm relationship for years to come. 

**Peer Reviews**

Each quarter we partner with the AR team to identify a priority platform for driving Peer Reviews. We run dedicated efforts to drive an increase in quality reviews that will create an impact in upcoming reports. 

**Events**

Our mighty team of two provides Tier 1 event support as resources allow. 

For Tier 1 events, please notify the advocacy team during quarterly OKR planning and include the advocacy team at event kickoff. 

For other events, we are currently unable to support speaker sourcing. We will however assist in sharing suggestions based on our relationships with advocates. Please tag Steve George into your event content issue and we will be happy to share ideas directly.


**Quarterly Customer Advocacy Award**

To formally recognize members of our revenue organization who partner with marketing to identify and create customer stories, our Customer Advocacy team is launching a new quarterly Customer Advocacy Award. The winner of this award will receive an exclusive GitLab-branded Yeti cooler and tumbler gift kit delivered to their door. For Q1, the winner will be announced at SKO. For other quarters the winners will be sharing on the WW Field Call. 

  FY23 Q4 Winner: April Marks, Enterprise AE
