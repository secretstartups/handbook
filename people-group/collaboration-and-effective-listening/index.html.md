**What is collaboration?**

Collaborate, according the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, means “to work jointly with others or together especially in an intellectual endeavor.”

A workforce, also according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is comprised of “the people engaged in a specific activity or enterprise.”

## Communication: Speak Clearly & Listen Openly







Think about a time that you tried to share information on how to complete a task with someone and although the task was completed, it was not completed to your satisfaction, what happened and what could you have done?

**What is communication?**

- Communication is the exchange of ideas from one to another.

**What is effective communication?**

- Effective communication depends on clarity, speech patterns, and the intonation conveyed by the sender of the message. Effective communication is also the ability of the listener to attend to the message.
