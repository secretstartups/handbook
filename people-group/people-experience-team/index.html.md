### OOO Handover Process for People Experience Team

1. The People Experience Associate will create a document the day before their scheduled OOO with the following:
- What urgent tasks are there that need to be reassigned:
* Onboarding
* Offboarding
* Career Mobilities
* Any other tasks
- Is there anything else that we should be made aware of and contribute to whilst you are away?
2. The People Experience Coordinator will then reassign tasks to an alternative People Experience Associate.
3. Get assistance from the People Operation Specialist team if additional hands are needed.

### OOO Process for People Experience Coordinator

1. When the People Experience Coordinator is due to be OOO, the People Experience Associates will allocate the relevant tasks between themselves.
2. In the event that there are items that need urgent attention whilst the People Experience Coordinator is OOO, the Coordinator will hand over the relevant tasks to the People Experience Team Lead or People Experience Associates.

## People Experience Team Processes

### Bi-Weekly Rotations 

On a bi-weekly occurence, the People Experience Team will open a [PEA Rotation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Weekly-Rotation-PEA.md). This rotation issue reflects what tasks the PEA's are accountable for and to be completed within the 2 weeks which lists how the tasks are shared amongst the team. The allocation tracker can be found in the [People Exp/Ops Tracker]. 

Certain tasks will be allocated based on a ongoing rotation between all People Experience Associates. 

The following factors will also be taken into consideration:

- Scheduled PTO for the team members
- Ensure that the tasks split evenly and fairly 
- A tracker will be kept to track the data of how the tasks are split up

**The Rotation groups are listed as follows:**

- Probation Periods / Gift Requests / Anniversary Period 
- BHR Onboarding Report / Moo Report / Allocations for Onboarding, Offboarding, Mobility / TaNEWki call scheduling / Pull Social Call Metrics

- I-9 Administration / Pruning of Stale Records (TBD)

**The following tasks will be completed by any available People Experience Associate within the designated SLA:**

- Letters of Employment / VOE 
- Anniversary Queries

#### Allocations for Onboarding

- We always try and split evenly and fairly.
- Not time zone specific to ensure that all Associates learn all aspects to different countries during onboarding. 

#### Allocations for Offboarding

- Team has 12 hours to create and notify of the offboarding issue.
- The person that is in the allocation rotation will also add the offboarding to the PEA team calendar.
- Due to different time zones, the offboarding issue creation and task completion can be tagged team by the Associates. 

#### Allocations for Career Mobility 

- We always try and split evenly and fairly. 

### Audits & Quarterly Rotations

There are certain tasks that need to be completed by all the different departments and team members and we as the People Experience Team need to ensure to remain compliant in line with these tasks. Herewith a breakdown of the important compliance and team tasks:  

- Onboarding

This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members onboarding. 

    - Ensure that the new team member has shared a screenshot of their FileVault disk encryption and computer serial number in the onboarding issue. 
    - Ensure that the new team member has acknowledged the 'Handbook' compliance task in the onboarding issue. 
    - Ensure that the manager tasks are completed prior to and after the new team member has started. 
    - Ensure that an onboarding buddy has been assigned to assist the new team member. 
    - Ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the onboarding issue.

- Offboarding

This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members offboarding. 

    - Ensure that all the different departments complete their tasks within the 5 day due date. 
    - Immediate action is required from the People Experience Team and the IT Ops Team once the issue has been created. 
    - Ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the offboarding issue.
    - Confirm that a departure announcement has been made in #team-member-updates on Slack.

- Career Mobility 

This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members career mobility issue. 

    - Check to see whether the team member that has migrated needs any guidance.
    - Ensure that the previous manager and current manager completes their respective tasks. 
    - The issue should be closed within 2 weeks of creation, ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the issue.

**Over and above these audits, the Compliance Specialist will perform their own audits to ensure that certain tasks have been completed.**

- Code of Conduct Audit

The People Experience Team will complete a quarterly audit of which team members have not yet signed the Code of Conduct in BambooHR. 

    - A monthly report will be pulled from BambooHR for `Code of Ethics Acknowledgment 2020` by the Associate in the respective rotation to check that all pending team member signatures have been completed. 
    - If it has not been signed by the team member, please select the option in BambooHR to send a reminder to the team member to sign. Please also follow up via Slack and ask the team member to sign accordingly. 
    - If there are any issues, please escalate to the People Experience Team Lead for further guidance. 

- HelloSign Audit

    - On a quarterly basis, the People Experience Associate in the respective rotation will pull a report from HelloSign with the full list of active team members. 
    - In the correct Slack channel `hellosign-review`, the Associate will cross reference the current team members in that channel vs the report from HelloSign (add any missing team members to the Channel).
    - Announce in the channel that an audit is being completed and ask team member to update the spreadsheet confirming their usage. 
    - Create an access request to remove any non active team members as well as removing them from HelloSign. 

- Anniversary Gift Stock Audit

The People Experience Team will complete a quarterly stock audit of the anniversary gift items in Printfection. If the stock is low, we will proceed with placing an order for new stock to the warehouse. 

### Pulling of BambooHR Onboarding Data

Every Monday and Wednesday, the Associate in the rotation will pull the report that has been shared in BambooHR called `New Hires`. The data for the next 2 weeks will be added to the spreadsheet to ensure sufficient time in completing the pre-onboarding tasks. 

1. Open BHR and select the Onboarding Tracker Report
1. Click on the hire date until it is showing the hire dates in order
1. Highlight and copy the data of all the new hires starting the next week and following 
  - Keep name format as (Last Name, First Name)
1. Paste the data into the People Experience Onboarding Tracker at the bottom 
1. If a name is highlighted, this means the name is already on the tracker. Review that the hire date is the same and delete the highlighted field you just added. 
1. If the name is not highlighted this is a new add and keep the name on the tracker. 

### Weekly Moo Report

Every week, the People Experience Associate in the rotation creates a Report in BambooHR containing all Active Employees in three columns: their First Name, their Last Name, their GitLab work email. People Experience Associate adds this data to the `GitLab : Moo` spreadsheet in a new weekly tab titled that Tuesday's date (format yyyy-mm-dd) so that our Moo Rep can grab this data and send out email invitations to new team members from the Moo platform.

Please note that all info from the report is added to the sheet, including any past hires. The Moo system will only send the invitation to the new members not previously listed on the sheet. This ensures that any potential missed members still receive their invitation.

### Letters of Employment and Employee Verification Requests

This lists the steps for the People Experience team to follow when receiving requests:

#### Letters of Employment 

Once the team member completes the form as listed in the [Handbook](/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#letter-of-employment), we will receive an email in the People Experience Inbox to view and audit if the information has been correctly inserted by the team member. 
- If the information is correct, please proceed with forwarding the Letter of Employment to the team member by email. 
- If the information is incorrect, please email the team member and provide the details of what is incorrect and ask that they resubmit the form with the correct information. 

#### Employee Verifications

We may be contacted by different vendors who require a team members employment to be verified along with other personal information. 

Most importantly, check to see whether authorisation has been received from the team member that we may provide the personal information. If no authorisation form is attached, make contact with the team member via email or Slack to get the required consent. 
- If the vendor is asking for general information in the email, simply respond back to the email with the requested information. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed, complete the form via HelloSign and encrypt the document before sending via email. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed for a US team member, forward this request on to the US Payroll team to have completed. 
- If you need additional figures that we do not have access to, send a message in the `payroll-peopleops` Slack channel to request the information needed to complete the form. 

In some instances, we may be contacted by certain Governmental institutions asking for clarity into termination / seperation reasons and agreements of a team member. Please forward these emails to the relevant People Business Partner that submitted the offboarding notification, as they will have full context into the reasons and agreements and will choose to respond if needed. 

### Probation Period Rotation

The People Experience Associate in the `Probation Period` rotation, will complete the full process as per the steps listed in the [Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/contracts-and-international-expansion/#important-steps-during-the-probation-period). If the weekly rotation has come to an end and not all confirmations have been received, the Associate in the next weeks rotation will follow up with team members managers.

### OSAT Team Member Feedback

Once a new team member has completed their onboarding, they are asked to complete the `Onboarding Survey` to share their experience. Based on the scores received, the People Experience Associate assigned to the specific team members onboarding, will complete the following:

- Score of 4 or higher: use own discretion based on the feedback received and see whether there are any improvements or changes that can be made to the onboarding template / onboarding process (this can be subjective). 
- Score of 3 or lower: reach out to the team member and schedule a feedback session to further discuss their concerns and feedback provided. 

#### Onboarding Buddy Feedback

In the same survey, new team members are able to provide a score and feedback on their onboarding buddy. If the score and feedback received is constructive and valuable insights when the score is low, the People Experience Associate assigned to that specific team members onboarding, should reach out to the manager of the onboarding buddy and provide feedback in a polite and supportive way.  

### Anniversary Period Gift Queries

### Gift Requests

When a team member completes the GitLab gift form request, the People Experience team receives an email to people-exp@gitlab.com to process the request.
