### OOO Handover Process for People Experience Team

1. The People Experience Associate will open a PEA Handover OOO [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/PEA_OOO_Handover_Issue.md) and tag all Associates in the issue at least the day before their scheduled OOO.

### Bi-Weekly Rotations 

On a bi-weekly occurence, the People Experience Team will open a [PEA Rotation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Weekly-Rotation-PEA.md). This rotation issue reflects what tasks the PEA's are accountable for and to be completed within the 2 weeks which lists how the tasks are shared amongst the team.  

Certain tasks will be allocated based on a ongoing rotation between all People Experience Associates. 

The following factors will also be taken into consideration:

- Scheduled PTO for the team members

- A tracker will be kept to track the data of how the tasks are split up

**The following tasks will be completed by any available People Experience Associate within the designated SLA:**

### Audits and Quarterly Rotations

1. Open BHR and select the Onboarding Tracker Report

1. Highlight and copy the data of all the new hires starting the next week and following 
  - Keep name format as (Last Name, First Name)
1. Paste the data into the People Experience Onboarding Tracker at the bottom 
1. If a name is highlighted, this means the name is already on the tracker. Review that the hire date is the same and delete the highlighted field you just added. 
1. If the name is not highlighted this is a new add and keep the name on the tracker. 
1. **Important, if the team member is located in Japan, please immediately proceed with sending the required payroll documentation to the new hires personal email address.** Include Non US Payroll in the email correspondence for visibility.

### Monthly Reporting

#### Retaining & Purging Form I-9

Per the [USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Service](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/retention-and-storage), form I-9, which is completed for all US-based team members, must be retained and purged according to the USCIS retention policies.

**Form I-9 must be retained as long as a team member is Active. If a US-based team member is Inactive, Form I-9 must be purged 3 years after a team member's start date _or_ 1 year after their departure date, whichever is later.**

Example 1: Team member Marie Curie's start date was 2017-01-01 and she departed the company on 2021-06-01. Her Form I-9 must be purged after 2022-06-01.

Example 2: Team member Matt Gandhi's start date was 2019-06-01 but he departed on 2019-12-15. His Form I-9 must be purged after 2022-06-01.

1. The People Experience team must run a monthly report in BambooHR to show all Inactive US-based team members and compare it to Guardian's Inactive team member report. 
1. The People Experience team confirm the correct purging dates in the Guarding report using the above formula to calculate how long Form I-9 must be kept for the relevant team members and then purge them after the calculated time period. 
1. When a team member has passed a purging date, the People Experience team must:

    - Confirm with Guardian that the team member I-9 records have been deleted.
    - Review the team member's Verification folder in BambooHR to ensure that no form I-9 copies are present. Delete form I-9 if found. Receipt and confirmation of work eligibility do not need to be deleted.

### Letters of Employment and Employee Verification Requests

This lists the steps for the People Experience team to follow when receiving requests:

#### Letters of Employment 

Team Members are able to request a Letter of Employment using the [documented form](/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#letter-of-employment) for this purpose.  Once submitted they will receive an auto-populated document utilising the data housed in BambooHR i.e. compensation; length of tenure; nature of employment (full or part-time) etc. along with an indication that GitLab is an all remote company.

#### Employee Verifications

We may be contacted by different vendors who require a team members employment to be verified along with other personal information. 

Most importantly, check to see whether authorisation has been received from the team member that we may provide the personal information. If no authorisation form is attached, make contact with the team member via email or Slack to get the required consent. 
- If the vendor is asking for general information in the email, simply respond back to the email with the requested information. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed, complete the form via Docusign and encrypt the document before sending via email. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed for a US team member, forward this request on to the US Payroll team to have completed. 
- If you need additional figures that we do not have access to, send a message in the `payroll-peopleops` Slack channel to request the information needed to complete the form. 

In some instances, we may be contacted by certain Governmental institutions asking for clarity into termination / seperation reasons and agreements of a team member. Please forward these emails to the relevant People Business Partner that submitted the offboarding notification, as they will have full context into the reasons and agreements and will choose to respond if needed. 

#### Probation Period Rotation

The People Experience Associate in the `Probation Period` rotation, will complete the full process as per the steps listed in the [Probation Period](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#probation-period) section of the hanbook. If the weekly rotation has come to an end and not all confirmations have been received, the Associate in the next weeks rotation will follow up with team members managers.

#### Triage People Group Issues

The People Experience Associate in the 'triage' rotation will pull up all issues opened in the [General project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/issues) and tag / assign team members according to the request. It is important that once you have triaged the issue, to update the label from `workflow:triage` to `workflow:todo / doing`. 

#### Deleting Team Member Data from Letter of Employment Rotation

Once a week, the People Experience Associate in the `deleting team member data` rotation will delete team members data submitted on the Letter of Employment response spreadsheet for the previous week.

### OSAT Team Member Feedback

Once a new team member has completed their onboarding, they are asked to complete the `Onboarding Survey` to share their experience. Based on the scores received, the People Experience Associate assigned to the specific team members onboarding, will complete the following:

- Score of 4 or higher: use own discretion based on the feedback received and see whether there are any improvements or changes that can be made to the onboarding template / onboarding process (this can be subjective). 
- Score of 3 or lower: reach out to the team member and schedule a feedback session to further discuss their concerns and feedback provided. 

### Onboarding Buddy Feedback

In the same survey, new team members are able to provide a score and feedback on their onboarding buddy. If the score and feedback received is constructive and valuable insights when the score is low, the People Experience Associate assigned to that specific team members onboarding, should reach out to the manager of the onboarding buddy and provide feedback in a polite and supportive way.  

### Onboarding Cohort Creation

During the last week of the month, the PEA in the assigned rotation will create a new slack public channel for the next month by following the below steps: 

1. Create a new public slack channel with the naming convention `month-year-new-hire-lounge` and add in the People Experience team to start
1. Next, you'll want to go into the `donut` app in Slack and select `Donut Channel Settings` and this will pop open in a new window
1. Navigate to the `Templates` tab on the top of the page, find `New Hire Cohort Watercooler` and select `Preview` then `Use Template`
1. Select `Use an existing channel`, type in to find the newly created slack channel you just made and select `Add Donut Channel`
1. You'll want to make sure that the Program Basics are set up to twice a week (Tuesday and Thursday) and the Next Send Date is for the first Tuesday of the month and that the Intros option is toggled to `On`. Hit `Save`. 
1. Next you'll want to navigate to the Topics Queue tab and select Shuffle to mix up the questions from all the different packs. 
1. You're going to create 4 (or 5, depending on how many weeks the month has) custom questions by clicking `Add a Topic` near the top of the page. All 4 of these are going to be the same question of `Do you have any questions regarding GitLab onboarding?` and feel free to add a fun gif to the prompt as well. 
1. You'll want to make sure that your 4 custom prompts are the questions for the Thursdays within the first month. After the first month, every prompt will be a purely social one. You can organize the prompts by dragging and dropping the questions to be in the order you'd like them to be. Remember to hit `Save` at the top of the page once done.

The People Experience team have admin access to Slack and can assist team members with any PTO queries as per the process listed on the PTO Handbook [page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#instructions-for-people-ops-and-total-rewards-to-update-pto-by-roots-events). 

The People Experience team will also receive notifications of any news items from Slack, as well as sync issues between BambooHR and PTO by Roots. When receiving the email about issues with the sync, the People Experience Associate will verify whether it is a specific issue or whether it is related to a recent offboarding of a team member or if it is related to team members starting that week. The sync takes about 24 hours when it will then update to remove/add the specific team members. 

### Access Request Templates

When a new tool is [added to the Tech Stack](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#adding-access-request-process-for-a-new-item-in-the-tech-stack), the People Experience team is automatically pinged in the Access Request to create the relevant MR adding the tool to the offboarding template. 

- Important to check whether the tool should be in the main offboarding issue or if only a certain department/team will have access to the tool, in which case, this can be added to the specific department template. 

### Referral Bonus Audits

Weekly on a Friday, the People Experience team will be pinged in the `#peopleops-alerts` Slack channel to complete an audit of whether referral bonuses have been added to the referring team members profile in BambooHR (for referring new hires for the last 3 months).
