## Introduction

Welcome to the Manager Challenge page. We are rolling out a pilot 4 week manager challenge in September 2020, "The GitLab Great Managers Program." The pilot of this program will include a group of managers at GitLab. After the pilot, iterations will be made to the program and then rolled out to all GitLab managers. All details relating to the challenge can be found here on this page.

## FAQs

**What is the Manager Challenge Program?**

The program is intended to build a set of baseline management skills through micro habits and daily practices over the course of 4 weeks 

**Is this a Pilot launch?**

Yes. In September we are running a pilot and will be rolling out the program to the wider GitLab community very soon

**Do I have to participate?**

Participation is not required, but we strongly recommend that all invited Managers during the pilot complete the challenge. 

**What is required of me?**

Monday to Wednesday there will be a series of daily challenges that a manager can complete asynchronously on their own time that will cover a range of topics. On Thursday's we will come together as a group in a live learning session to apply the challenges to real scenarios managers face in a remote environment. 

**I have a lot of management experience, will this help?**

No matter your level or tenure as a People Leader, we can all take time out of our busy days to grow our management and leadership skills. The more practice the better and we hope that you will find the challenges applicable to your job.

**What skills will I be building?**

You will be building a range of skills that include: coaching, managing underperformance, crucial conversations, feedback, building an inclusive culture, developing high performing teams, and much more!  

**How does this complement our values?**

All of the challenges will reinforce our values by applying management techniques to lead others in a remote environment.  

**Is the content in the slides in the Handbook?**

Yes! All of the content will be in the Handbook. We are creating Google Slides to visualize the content for the challenges but all of it will live in the handbook. 

**What if I can’t attend a Live Learning session or complete a challenge?**

If you miss a challenge or live learning session you can go back and complete the challenge anytime. All of the material will be posted on this page, including the live learning recordings. 

**What if I am out of office for part of the program?**

As long as you complete the challenge and let the Learning and Development know when you have completed them, it is okay to be out of office. 

**I'm not a Manager, can I still participate?**

Yes, you can still participate but we ask that you complete the activities asynchronously for your own professional development. Once you are ready to become a Manager, you will be equipped with a set of baseline management skills. 

**How do I receive a certification?**

Yes! Once you complete all challenges, attend the live learning sessions, and complete the self-reflection activities, you will receive the "GitLab Managers Challenge" certification.
