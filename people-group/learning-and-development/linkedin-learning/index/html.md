## Overview

In January 2021, GitLab implemented LinkedIn Learning to provide our team members with more off the shelf learning resources. With a growing company, the needs for learning are growing as well and we are excited to provide this opportunity to our team members.  

## Benefit of LinkedIn Learning

Utilizing LinkedIn Learning will be beneficial to your professional development. With access to LinkedIn Learning, you will be able to access their over 8,000 courses on many different topics. 

### How to incorporate LinkedIn Learning into your day-to-day role 

We encourage all team members to [take time out to learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign). If you are working on a project and realize you need to know more about a certain topic or a certain tool, you can go to GitLab Learn and search for that to see if there are resources avialble to you.

### Take Time out to Learn

You can take time to learn about something that will help you in your current role. You can learn about things that can help you in a future role (maybe you are an aspiring manager). You can also take time to learn about things that are just fun for you like graphic design, drawing, or mindfulness. 

Finding courses and skills to learn just got easier with access to LinkedIn Learning. We have a [take time out to learn campaign](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign) where we encourage our team members to take time out of their work week to learn. That may be learning more to improve current skills or learning new skills completely. 

## Recommended Learning Paths

We have outlined recommended learning paths for different roles at GitLab. This is not an exhaustive list, but it is a good start if you are new to using the tool.
