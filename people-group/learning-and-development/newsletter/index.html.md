## Overview

This page covers the process our Learning and Development (L&D) team follows for creating the quarterly L&D Newsletter! 

To see currently availble editions of our L&D Newsletter, see our [Learning Culture]() page. 

## Newsletter Process 

The newsletter is live **on the first Wednesday of each Quarter.**  

We build the newsletter in an issue in the [Learning & Development Newsletter project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/newsletter). The process for the issue includes: 
- The issue for the upcoming newsletter is opened at least three weeks before the publish date. 
- Relevant stakeholders/contributors are tagged in the issue each month to provide content or review suggested content in the outline. 
- Once the outline is complete, L&D team drafts the newsletter in a WIP MR. 
- Reviewers provide feedback no later than 3 pm CT two business days before the planned go-live date to allow time for revisions.
- L&D Team announces the newsletter via slack on go live date. 
- Once the newsletter goes live, the L&D Team sends a slack notification in the #whats-happening-at-gitlab, #learninganddevelopment, and #managers Slack channels 
- Once the newsletter is live, the L&D team closes out the planning issue.
