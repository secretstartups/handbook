## Frequently asked questions


### When will content in GitLab Learn be available for the entire GitLab team, customers, and community members?

The LXP implementation team is planning a phased rollout of the platform to multiple GitLab audiences. Progress and additional information can be found on the [LXP implementation issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/edcast-lxp-implementation/-/boards)

### Where is the content in the LXP stored?

Content in GitLab Learn is developed using a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/) approach. All learning content is stored in the handbook. Teams at GitLab use additional tools like Articulate 360 and Rise to build interactive courses.

In addition to GitLab learning material stored in the handbook, GitLab team members will have access to off the shelf learning opportunity from other vendors and organizations, like LinkedIn Learning and WILL Learning.

### How can I contribute?

The contribution process to the LXP is being built, and you can follow updates in the [learning and development handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/).
