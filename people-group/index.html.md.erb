## Welcome

Welcome to the People Group handbook! You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here. You can also check out [pages related to People Group](/handbook/people-group/#other-pages-related-to-people-operations) in the next section below. If you can not find what you are looking for please do the following:

- [**The People Group**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops) holds several subprojects to organize the people group; please create an issue in the appropriate subproject or `general` if you're not sure. Please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to GitLab team-members. Similarly, if your question can be shared please use a public issue. Tag `@gl-peopleops` or `@gl-hiring` so the appropriate team members can follow up.
    - Please note that not all People Group projects can be shared in an issue due to confidentiality. When we cannot be completely transparent, we will share what we can in the issue description, and explain why.
    - [**Employment Issue Tracker**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates): Only Onboarding, Offboarding and Transition Issue Templates are held in this subproject, and they are created by the People Experience Team only. Interview Training Issues, are held in the [Training project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training) and created by the Recruiting team. Please see the [interviewing page](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#typical-hiring-timeline) for more info.
- [**Chat channel**](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/peopleops); Please use the `#peopleops` Slack chat channel for questions that do not seem appropriate for the issue tracker. For access requests regarding Google or Slack groups, please create an issue here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests. For questions that relate to Payroll and contractor invoices please direct your question to the `#payroll`, `#expense-reporting-inquiries` and `#finance` channel for Carta. Regarding questions for our recruiting team, including questions relating to access, or anything to do with Greenhouse, referrals, interviewing, or interview training please use the `#recruiting` channel. For more urgent general People Group questions, please mention `@peoplegeneral` to get our attention faster.
- If you need to discuss something that is confidential/private (including sensitive matters surrounding your team), you can send an email to the People Group: peopleops@gitlab.com.
- If you only feel comfortable speaking with one team member, you can ping an individual member of the People Group, as listed on our [Team page](/company/team/).
- If you wonder who's available and/or in what time zone specific team members of the People Group are, you can easily check via Google Calendar or the [GitLab Team Page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/)
- If you need help with any technical items, for example, 2FA, please ask in `#it_help`. The channel topic explains how to create an issue. For urgent matters you can mention `@it-ops-team`.

### People Business Partner (PBP) Holiday Coverage

In order to ensure the PBP team is able to take time off during the holidays, while simultaneously ensuring we are available for support should urgent items arise, we have put together a PBP holiday coverage on-call plan. While many of us will be on vacation, we will be on an emergency on-call rotation should something urgent arise and reachable via Whatsapp or a text message on our personal cell phones (which can be found in Slack). 

If you have something urgent that has arisen and your [aligned PBP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) is out of the office, please refer to Holiday Coverage Calendar table below. 

Before proceeding with contacting PBPs in line with the holiday coverage schedule, please consider:

1. Is this urgent?
    * Examples of urgent/time-sensitive requests: [gross misconduct](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/anti-harassment/#types-of-harassment), a medical emergency, an immediate resignation
    * Examples of non-urgent requests: a dip in performance, approval for a discretionary bonus
2. Is your aligned PBP available?
    * If your [aligned PBP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) is not on vacation, please reach out to them first.

#### Holiday Coverage Calendar

**As many of the PBPs will also be on vacation and not actively checking email and Slack, please send us a Whatsapp or text message to contact us as opposed to reaching out via Slack or email for timely responses. Our mobile numbers can be found in our Slack profiles.**

If your [aligned PBP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) is not on vacation, please reach out to them first. If they are not available, please contact any one of the other available PBPs. 

_Please be mindful of timezone when determining which PBP to reach out to._

| Week | Available PBPs | PBP Timezone
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| December 21 - 25 | Julie Armendariz | CST - GMT-6 (Dallas, TX) |
| December 21 - 25 | Carolyn Bednarz | EST - GMT-5 (Boston, MA) |
| December 21 - 25 | Giuliana Lucchesi | CST - GMT-6 (Chicago, IL) |

### People Business Partner Issue Board

The People Business Partners (PBPs) have an [issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1898818?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened) to track collaboration on issues across GitLab.com to keep us efficient and collaborative with other teams.

We utilize labels for triaging amongst the PBPs, and to indicate to other teams the level of priority for the PBPs and the status (doing, done, etc.)

#### Triaging and Labeling Flow

1. `pbp-attention` label is added by team member/group seeking input, collaboration, or feedback on an issue or MR. This will flag the issue for triaging on our People Business Partner issue board. _Note: While MRs will not appear on our board, we ask that the `pbp-attention` label is added regardless for analytics purposes._
1. The PBP team will triage the issue in accordance of PBP priority. Each scoped label will have one PBP DRI, _plus_ the additional number of PBP reviewers indicated depending on the level of priority.
1. The PBP who is the DRI will indicate they are the DRI by tagging themselves in the issue.

- `pbp::low` 1 PBP DRI with 1 additional reviewer
- `pbp::medium` 1 PBP DRI with 2 additional PBP reviewers
- `pbp::high` 1 PBP DRI with 3 additional PBP reviewers (at least one should be at the Director level)

1. If the issue is coming from another team seeking PBP collaboration, the PBP team will add the label of the other team for analytics purposes.

- `pbp-DIB` (Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging)
- `pbp-LD` (Learning & Development)
- `pbp-TR` (Total Rewards)
- `pbp-legal`
- `pbp-peopleops`
- `pbp-recruiting`
- `pbp-other`

1. The PBP team will add the `pbp-done` label when PBP action is complete.

You may reference the [GitLab.com labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&subscribed=&search=pbp) for an overview of all labels included in the PBP issue board triaging and labeling process.

## Support provided by Director of Legal, Employment, to the People Group.

The Director of Legal, Employment, collaborates with and provides support to the People Business Partner team in many functional areas.

Email approval from the Director of Legal, Employment is required prior to engagement with external counsel to allow for accurate tracking of costs.

Invoices will be sent to Director of Legal, Employment, for approval with the relevant People Business Partner copied for visibility.

## Support provided by the People Operations Specialist team to the People Business Partner team

All tasks will be assigned via slack in the #pbp-peopleops slack channel. This is a private channel. The People Operations Specialist team, will self-assign a task, within 24 hours and comment in slack on the request to confirm.

## Boardroom addresses
{: #addresses}

- For the SF boardroom, see our [visiting](/company/visiting/) page.
- For the NL office, we use a postbox address listed in the "GitLab BV address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password. We use [addpost](https://www.addpost.nl) to scan our mail and send it to a physical address upon request.
- For the UK office, there is a Ltd registered address located in the "GitLab Ltd (UK) Address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password
- For the Germany office, there is a GmbH address located in the "GitLab GmbH Address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password

## Guidelines for Vendor meetings

These guidelines are for all Vendor meetings (e.g. People Group/Recruiting IT system providers, 3rd party suppliers, benefits providers) to enable us to get the best out of them and make the most of the time allotted:

Guidelines:

1. We request external vendor meetings to use our video conferencing tool so we can quickly join the call and record the session if we need to. Confirm with vendor that they agree we can record the call. The DRI for the vendor meeting will generate the zoom link and share with the vendor.
1. Decide ahead of the meeting who should be invited, i.e. those likely to get the most out of it.
1. Ahead of the meeting, we should agree internal agenda items/requirements/priorities and provide to the external provider.
1. In order to make the best use of time, we wish to avoid team introductions on the call, particularly where there are a number of us attending. We can include a list of attendees with the agenda and give it to the vendor before or after the meeting.
1. When a question or issue is raised on the agenda, if the person who raised it is present they will verbalize it live on the call; or if they are not present, then someone will raise it for them. This is a common GitLab practice.
1. Where possible, we request that the vendor provides their slides / presentation materials and any other related information after the meeting.
1. Do not demo your tool live, create a pre-recorded walk-through of the tool and make it available to GitLab before the meeting so we can ask questions if needed.
1. Be cognizant of using inclusive language.
1. We respectfully request that everyone is mindful of the time available, to help manage the call objectives effectively.

## Reporting potential inaccurate LinkedIn Profiles

GitLab does not actively search for LinkedIn profiles that have inaccurate information about being a GitLab Team member.  However, there are instances where a profile is identified and there is question on whether the person is truly a GitLab team member.  Here is the process for flagging a potentially inaccurate profile and the actions that the People Specialist team will do to confirm and potentially report a profile.

- Team members should first check in Slack and/or on the organizational page to determine if the team member is a current GitLab team member.
- If the team member cannot confirm the profle, team members should reach out to the People Specialist team via the **`@peopleops_spec`** tag in the #peopleops Slack channel with the LinkedIn profile in question.
- The People Operations Specialist will confirm in BambooHR that they are not/have not been a team member.
- The People Operations Specialist will confirm with recruiting to confirm if they have ever been interviewed, made an offer or were declined.
- The People Operations Specialist will reach out to the Community Operations Manager to confirm if they are an active member via slack @community-relations @community team.
- If they are a confirmed member of the community but not a team member, the Community Operations Manager will reach out the profile and ask them to change their profile to match their GitLab involvement. 
- If they are not a current member of the Community and recruiting has confirmed they do not have a profile in Greenhouse, recruiting will create a Do Not Hire profile.
- The People Operations Specialist will report the account to LinkedIn via the [Reporting Inaccurate Information on Another Member's Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/30200?src=or-search&veh=www.google.com%7Cor-search)


## Sending an E-Card

Another nice way to celebrate someone, express your appreciation or show support to a team member is by creating an e-card and having team members sign the card via HelloSign. Have have fun with this, get creative when making the card using google docs, google slides or a program of your choice. 
An example can be found [here](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:6034eed9-38e3-440e-bf5a-297905e13f06).
Once you have your card created:

1. Upload the document to either HelloSign or Docusign
1. Once uploaded, assign signatures to those individuals that you would like to sign and then send the request to those individuals
1. When an individual has signed you will get an email notification
1. After you have all of your signatures then download the document from HelloSign
1. Slack or email the card to the recipient

## **Using BambooHR**

We use [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com) to keep all team member information
in one place. All team members (all contract types) are in BambooHR.
We don't have one contact person but can email BambooHR if we want any changes made in the platform. The contact info lives in the Secretarial Vault in 1Password.

Some changes or additions we make to BambooHR require action from our team members.
Before calling the whole team to action, prepare a communication to the team that is approved by the Chief People Officer.

Team Members have access to their profile in BambooHR and should update any data that is outdated or incorrect. If there is a field that cannot be updated, please reach out to the People Ops Analyst with the change.

The mobile app has less functionality than the full website, and the current version has security issues, so use of the BambooHR mobile app is discouraged. If access to BambooHR is required from a mobile device (such as requests that need to be approved), this should be done through the desktop version of the website or through the mobile device's web browser.

## Using Google Drive

**We are a handbook first organziation and google drive should only be utilized when necessary.**

When using google drive, always save team documents to the appropriate [Shared_Drive].

## Using RingCentral

Our company and office phone lines are handled via RingCentral. The login credentials
are in the Secretarial vault on 1Password. To add a number to the call handling & forwarding
rules:

- From the Admin Portal, click on the Users button (menu on left), select the user for which you
want to make changes (for door handling, pick extension 101).
- A menu appears to the right of the selected user; pick "Call Handling & Forwarding" and review
the current settings which show all the people and numbers that are alerted when the listed User's
number is dialed.
- Add the new forwarding number, along with a name for the number, and click Save.

## WBSO (R&D tax credit) in the Netherlands

For roles directly relating to Research and Development in the Netherlands, GitLab may be eligible for the [WBSO (R&D Tax Credit)](http://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/wbso).

### Organizing WBSO

**Applications**

As of 2019 GitLab must submit three applications each year and the deadlines for those are as follows:

1. **31 March 2019**, for the May - August 2019 period (Product Manager for Create Features)
1. **31 August 2019**, for the September - December 2019 period (Product Manager for Gitaly)
1. **30 November 2019**, for the January - April 2020 period (Product Manager for Geo Features)

There is a [translated English version of the application template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15B1VDL-N-FyLe84mPAMeJnSKjNouaTcNqXeKxfskskg/edit) located in the WBSO folder on the Google Drive. The applications should be completed by a Product Manager, responsible for features or a service within GitLab, who can detail the technical issues that a particular feature will solve. Assistance on completing the application can also be sought from the WBSO consultant (based in the Netherlands). The contact details for the consultant can be found in a secure note in the People Ops 1Password vault called WBSO Consultant. The People Operations Specialist team will assist with co-ordinating this process. It is currently owned by Finance.

Each year a spreadsheet with the project details and hours logged against the work done on the project(s) will need to be created. This is for the entire year. The current hour tracker is located in the WBSO folder on the Google Drive, and shared only with the developers that need to log their hours (located in the Netherlands), Total Rewards Analysts, Finance and the WBSO consultant. Once the projects have been completed for the year, the WBSO consultant will submit the hours and project details to claim the R&D grant from the [RVO](https://english.rvo.nl/). The WBSO consultant will contact Total Rewards Analysts should they have any queries.

## Disaster Recovery Plan

When a natural disaster or weather event occurs in a location that is near the home of a team member, the People Specialist and People Experience Teams (known as the People Operations Team) will send a notification email to all relevant team members, using the [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/email_templates/natural_disaster_notification.md) found in the People Group project.

GitLab provides free transport to all team members to get out of the location they are in, via a vendor of choice e.g.: Uber/ Taxify/ Lyft/ Via etc. to a safe location.
This section outlines what action will be taken during a natural disaster:

- We get notified of these incidents and disasters by team members affected as well as other team members at GitLab. We also have an automated bot that feeds the #disaster-recovery-plan slack channel, from the [Global Disaster Alerts and Coordination](https://gdacs.org/). We do not react the green or orange notifications, but do react and action any alerts that are highlighted as "red". 
- This is a shared task amongst the overall People Operations Team, a member on this team will reach out in the timezone of the team members affected by a natural disaster/ etc. via email by using this [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/email_templates/natural_disaster_notification.md). Please review the template before sending and add country/ location specific links and information.
- To protect team member's privacy, send one email to all affected team members' Bcc'd.
- All managers of the affected team members, as well as `peoplepartners @gitlab.com` will also be bcc'd and `peopleops @gitlab.com` will be cc'd.
- A Slack message will also be posted on the location Slack channel and if unavailable in the #team-member-updates channel or direct message. 
- The People Operations Team  will make a post in the #disaster-recovery-plan slack channel with the number of team members notified. This channel will include leaders of legal, security and the people team. The People operations or People Experience team will update the channel on their course of action and whether all team members have been reached during this process.
- If there is no response from the team member/s within 24 hours, the People Operations Specialist and People Experience teams will send an email to the team member/s personal email address. Due to the vast number of time zones we operate in, and for transparency, please cc peopleops@ gitlab.com in all communications.
- If there is still no response after 48 hours, a People Operations Specialist or People Experience Associate will reach out to next-of-kin (this info can also be found in BambooHR) via email, and if no response, followed by a phone call.
