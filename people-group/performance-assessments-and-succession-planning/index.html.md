# Overview

There are many Talent Assessment Options, we have opted to use a Performance/Potential Matrix (commonly known as "9-Box" in the US). GitLab's Performance/Potential Matrix is a type of Talent Assessment that forms part of our [Talent Development Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-development-program/). 

To ensure we remain efficient, we built a [Performance/Potential Assessment Tool](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/assessment-tool/), this is currently [(CY20-Q3 / FY21-Q3)](/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines) being tested by a few teams, to provide feedback and iteration prior to launching company-wide.   


# The Performance/Potential Matrix

| | | | |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Exceeding** | Team member is performing well in their current job but needs to continue development in current role, or may have valuable technical skills but has not exhibited leadership potential. Team member has not demonstrated willingness to take on significantly greater scope and responsibility in the next 12 months. | Team member performs well in their current job, makes valuable contributions and consistently demonstrates competencies required. May be ready to take on greater scope and responsibility in the next 12 months | Team member is developing faster than the demands of their current position and/or division. Team member has been given additional assignments and has demonstrated high-level commitment/achieved significant results. Team member is ready to broaden their skill set and take on significantly greater scope and responsibility |
| **Performing** | Team member is currently meeting expectations of their role. Team member is not prepared to absorb additional scope or complexity in the next 12-24 months. | Team member is currently meeting expectations but may not be willing or able to advance; may not be ready to absorb additional scope or complexity in  the next 12-24 months. | Team member is contributing as expected and is meeting performance expectations. Team member may be ready to take on greater technical and/or leadership responsibility in  the next 12-24 months. |
| **Developing** | Team member is not meeting performance expectations and there is still more to learn in the current position. There are questions about their ability  to succeed in the current role long-term. | Team member has not been in the position long enough to adequately demonstrate their technical abilities, or may have lost pace with changes in the organization. | Team member is not meeting the requirements in their current role. It is possible that team member could be more successful in the current role with more  direction or in another role or department that more appropriately suits their skill set. |
| Performance ↑ Potential →  | **Low Potential** | **Medium Potential** | **High Potential** |

This matrix is an individual assessment tool that evaluates both a team members current contribution to the organization and their potential level of contribution.
It is commonly used in succession planning as a method of evaluation an organization's talent pool, identifying potential leaders, and identifying any gaps or risks.
It is regularly considered a catalyst for robust dialogue and is considered more accurate than one person's opinion.
The performance/potential matrix can be a diagnostic tool for development.

### Performance/Potential Overview

Below are examples for Managers to consider when compiling their criteria set, some of which speak to productivity and others to potential giving a balanced sense of where the team member should be placed in the matrix:

| Criteria | Points for Consideration |
| --- | --- | 
| **Output Delivery** | Is the team member consistently able to produce adequate results within the predefined scope of their role - consider this in parallel with applicable Job Family. |
| **Solution Centricity** | Is the team member able identify solutions and achieve results in an innovative way, is there an awareness of over-arching company strategies and are they contributing in some way to the achievement of them. |
| **Core Value Alignment** | Does the team member consistently demonstrate the core [GitLab Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/), always operating within the best interests of the company and those who work in it. |
| **Self-Directed Career Mobility** | is the team member able to learn and adapt quickly - applying the knowledge gained to overcoming challenging situations and achiving the desired results. |
| **Leadership Competencies** | Does the team member exhibit the [competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#manager-and-leadership-competencies) required to become a Manager / Leader within GitLab and if so do they require further development in these areas. |
| **Promotion Readiness** | Is the team member ready to move into a more senior role within GitLab - if not what would you consider the time frame for development to be. |
| **Team Dynamics** | Does the team member collaborate well with other team members, peers, and stable counterparts? Are they someone people are happy to work with? Data sources for this information can be a variety of things, ranging from 360 feedback, observations in team meetings, 1:1 conversation/feedback, etc.|

We elaborate on these points below when breaking providing a more in depth overview of performance measurement criteria and potential measurement criteria. 

## What is "Performance"?

Performance is broken into three areas: Developing, Performing, and Exceeding.

### Developing

Around 10-15% of the team generally fall into the “Developing” category. Based on the Job Family responsibilities, CREDIT values and remote working competencies, team members in this category are not meeting all of the expectations. There is still more to learn and improve on in the current position to achieve the desired results. This may be due to the following: 

- The team member has not been in the position/at GitLab long enough to adequately demonstrate performance.
- The team member has been recently promoted and needs time to ramp up performance in the new role. 
- The team member may have lost pace with changes in the organization. 
- The team member is not committed to the job responsibilities and/or GitLab. 
- The team member finds it difficult to perform work in a way that is aligned with our CREDIT values and/or competencies. 
- The team member's performance is aligned to our values and competencies, however, they lack results for Job Family responsibilities. 
- Team member was part of a recent [transfer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#department-transfers) and is still learning how to be successful on their new team.

Examples: 

- The team member needs a lot of guidance from the manager with the majority of tasks to understand requirements and deliverables expected.
- The team member is missing important due dates which is affecting the team, GitLab and/or customers. 
- The team member still needs to adapt remote working best practices. For example, the team member is not responsive. 
- The team member lacks (a part of) the knowledge, skills and abilities which are required for the role, resulting in a low quality of work being delivered.
- There is a significant mis-alignment (I.E. The team member struggles to collaborate with others, the team member does not work iteratively and key metrics are impacted, etc.) 

### Performing

Most team members (60-65%) fall into the “Performing” category. Based on Job family responsibilities, CREDIT values and remote working competencies team members in this category are “on track” and meeting all expectations. They can independently and competently perform all aspects of the job family responsibilities in a way that is aligned with our CREDIT values and competencies. Their performance consistently meets the requirements, standards, or objectives of the job, and they can occasionally exceed expectations. They deliver results in a timely and accurate fashion. This performance may be expected as a result of: 

- The team member is consistent and stable in their performance.  
- The team member has the required knowledge, skills and abilities to perform in the role successfully and also apply CREDIT values and competencies in their work.
- The team member has adapted to remote working and their knowledge, skills, and abilities align seamlessly to their role at GitLab. 

Examples: 

- While consistently meeting expectations, the team member does not regularly exceed expectations.
- Team member does not frequently express interest in additional projects, responsibilities, or work outside of their immediate scope.
- The team member is exemplifying our values in their work, but might have 1-2 competencies to improve on. 

### Exceeding

A relatively small portion of team members (about 25%) generally fall into the “Exceeding” category. Team members that are exceeding consistently surpass the demands of their current position and/or division. They demonstrate unique understanding of work beyond the assigned area of responsibility. They contribute to GitLab’s success by adding significant value well beyond job requirements, CREDIT values, and competencies. This performance may be expected as a result of: 

- Individual is developing more quickly than the demands of their current position. 
- They rise to the challenge when give additional assignments and achieves significant results.
- A “go-to” team member for their peers for tough problems and day-to-day guidance.
- High commitment and engagement to GitLab combined with extensive knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform in the role. 

Examples: 

- Constantly seeks opportunities to improve both self and organization. 
- The team members exemplify great ways of giving and receiving feedback - incorporating this directly in their work. 
- The team members are ambassadors for the CREDIT values, take full ownership of delivering projects, and very rarely miss due dates. 

### The Performance Factor

While the primary objective of the performance axis of the Performance/Potential Matrix is to calibrate team member performance, this axis of the matrix also directly impacts the [Performance Factor](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#performance-factor), which is a determining factor in the annual compensation review. Please reference the [Total Rewards Performance Factor page](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#performance-factor) for more detail on compensation impact.

### Measuring Performance

How can managers determine whether their team members are Developing, Performing, or Exceeding? "The Performance Factor" = Job Family Responsibilities (60%) + Competencies (40%). It is _optional_ to use [The Performance Factor Workheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHe-Vb6y6F4HXsek3sObV4IVNAGaTvXGi_9fbatT0Uo/edit#gid=241716076) for weighing the different Performance Factors.


#### Job Family

Performance against job family role, requirements, and performance indicators should be weighted at 60%. 

* Review Job Families: Look at the Responsibilities section/how this previously was feeding into Compa Groups for the roles in your department.
    * Example: [Software Engineer in Test](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/software-engineer-in-test/#responsibilities)
* Review Performance indicators per Job Family: Look at the Performance indicators.
    * Example: [Software Engineer in Test](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/software-engineer-in-test/#performance-indicators)

For management roles, please also review and consider the [levels](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#levels) outlined in the Organizational Structure. 

#### Competencies

Performance against competencies should be weighted at 40%. 

* [Values Competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies)
* [Remote Working Competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies)
* _(if applicable)_ [Functional Competenceis](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#functional-competencies) 
* _(if applicable)_ [Manager and Leadership Competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#manager-and-leadership-competencies) 

## What is "Potential"?

While performance is focused on the past and present, potential is focused on the future. Because of the nature of the future-focus associated with potential, it is more difficult to measure than performance, and inherently more qualitative than quantitative. A key element in determining potential is the manager and leadership observation and experience working with team members.  Managers can guage team member potential against the expectations in their current role or their potential to take on different roles across GitLab. 

Potential refers to the ability and desire of a team member to successfully assume increasingly more broad or complex responsibilities and learn new skills, as compared to peers and the roles' responsibilities outlined in their respective job family. This could include the potential to move up to the next level in their job family, and/or a lateral move. 

Potential *can change* over time as team members develop new interests, as new opportunities for growth arise, and as team members continue to broaden their knowledge, skills, and abilities. 

### Low

Low potential generally refers to a team member who is working at full potential against the roles and responsibilities outlined in their job family. There could be a variety of reasons for this, including:

* Lack of motivation to learn new skills or take on new projects
* Motivated to do what is needed in current job, not in what is required in a higher level
* Not expressing interest or demonstrating desire to move up or laterally 


Please note that low potential *does not* equate to low performance, but has more to do with the team member's readiness and promotability for future opportunities. 

### Medium

Medium potential generally refers to a team member who is growing in their current role and demonstrating interest in advancing (up or laterally) and they exhibit knowledge, skills, and abilities that indicate this. Team members with medium potential generally:

* Show interest in areas outside of their immediate scope occasionally
* Are comfortable in their current role
* Are a stable counterpart for other team members (especially for peers and more junior team members)
* Learn and apply new skills when the job calls for it; apply lessons learned to enhance success

### High

High potential generally indicates that a team members will be ready for promotion within the next year (or when an opportunity arises). High potential team members:

* Frequently seek involvement in stretch project/projects outside of their scope
* Invest in their development; seeks feedback to improve and applies that feedback on the job 
* Demonstrates ability to learn new skills
* Actively pursues in creased opportunities to influence decisions and inspire others

## Calibration Session Guidelines

The portion of the Performance/Potential matrix that often entails the most significant time commitment is the live calbiration session of team members with leadership. The calibration session is very valuable to ensure consistency across the job family and level, raise any questions, and provide cross-departmental and/or cross-divisional feedback on team members to capture the assessment of different managers as opposed to the opinion of the direct manager exclusively. 

### Pre Work

It is **absolutely essential** that managers complete the required pre-work to ensure that the live calibration sesison is as efficient and productive as possible. Pre work includes:

- Review the job family/families that will be reviewed in detail
- Review our competencies 
    - [Values competencies](/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies)
    - [Remote work competencies](/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies)
    - [Functional competencies](/handbook/competencies/#functional-competencies) _(if applicable)_
- Review our [Unconscious Bias](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/) handbook page and consider watching our [Recognizing Bias Training](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/#recognizing-bias-training) if you haven't already. 
- Review the [Performance/Potential Matrix Training Information](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/151ys8xkOak9ifU9IPXQydZ44sb_BoMpMocWmjVonLHE/edit), which delves into definitions for each box. 
- Determine the appropriate box for each of your team members
- Add notes for each of your team members to the agenda 
    - An example of notes could include:
        - 2-3 strengths
        - 2-3 improvement areas
        - Anything else noteworthy (I.E. recently promoted, COVID impact, etc.)
- Review the notes of your peers for other team members and add feedback/questions/thoughts for discussion

### Calibration Session

The calibration session is one of the most important pieces of the Performance/Potential Matrix process, as it provides time for managers, their peers, and their manager to calibrate. Guidelines to ensure efficiency during calibration sessions are:
* It may not be needed to discuss every team member in detail. Calibration sessions typically focus on "surprises". 
* Be conscious of time and consider setting a (reasonable) time limit per team member being discussed. 
* **Ask questions and provide feedback!** This may seem obvious, but it is import aspect to help identify any potential bias
* Leaders should feel comfortable highlighting team members in other functions

## Matrix Tool

Our goal is to have the whole company use the the Matrix [Assessment Tool](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/assessment-tool/) for the Performance/Potential matrix. However, while the tool is being developed and tested, groups who want to get a head start on the Performance/Potential matrix can use the [Performance/Potential Matrix team template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/123fS20lqXt-bhDEqwMCyL2K1BAcgVCEd61pQW6FmfRw/edit#slide=id.g817046ecd3_0_44).

## Identifying Action 

There is an overview of recommended actions to take after the calibration session included in the [Performance/Potential Training Information](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/151ys8xkOak9ifU9IPXQydZ44sb_BoMpMocWmjVonLHE/edit#slide=id.g88f412eeb7_1_13) from slide 26- 35. Additionally, this matrix can facilitate: 
* [Career Development Conversations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/leadership-toolkit/career-development-conversations/)
* Promotion planning 

## Timeline

### Regular Cadence

Our e-group completes Performance/Potential Matrix quarterly for all their direct reports. The rest of GitLab does this twice annually, ideally in Q2 and Q4. In Q2, the exercise would ideally take place after the [360 annual feedback review](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/), and in Q4 the exercise would ideally take place in November prior to the [annual compensation review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#annual-compensation-review). 

#### Eligibility

Anyone hired on or before October 31st is eligible to participate in the Q4 Performance/Potential matrix annual review. However, if the team member being assessed has been with GitLab for a period of 3 months or less, it is likely that these team members will fall into `Developing` for performance and should not expect a compensation adjustment, although they are still eligible to be reviewed.

This is because team members generally need several months to get adjusted to their role and responsibilities, and we ideally would have hired the team member at their accurate market rate. 

While there are exceptions, this is the general rule of thumb. 

### Initial Launch Timeline

GitLab is kicking off the Performance/Potential Matrix in FY'21 Q3 in preparation for the [annual review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#annual-compensation-review) in FY'21 Q4. The timeline for launch, training, and completion of the exericse is as follows:

### Matrix Assessment Timeline 

The Performance/Potential Matrix typically takes 4-6 weeks to complete from beginning to end. Steps are as follows:

1. Managers complete a Performance/Potential Matrix for their respective teams
1. Live session takes place for calibration 
1. Executive Review (leadership meets to review the matrix results, promotion requests, development and performance actions, review discrepancies, and measure against previous matrix results).
1. Performance axis results communited with team members. 
1. Retrospace takes place with leadership to determine next steps and iterate. 

## Communication 

In most companies the Performance/Potential Matrx is used exclusively as a management tool and results are not typically shared with team members. In the spirit of our transparency value, we want to encourage feedback resulting from calibration sessions to be communicated with team members, but refrain from communicating box-specific placement. **Discussion topics that arise during calibration sessions (or at any other point during the assessment process) are confidential. Please do not share with anyone other than each individual team member.**

The guidelines below are general guidelines and recommendations. However, *each department is at liberty to determine what works best for their groups*. For example, we have some departments that have used the Performance/Potential Matrix in previous quarters. These groups may feel comfortable and ready to communicate potential at this stage. We do, however, recommend that there is _consistency in what is being communicated within each department_. 

We hope to increase the scope of our communication company-wide as we iterate on the the Performance/Potential Matrix process and continue to define criteria and receive feedback after the first iteration in Q4 FY`21. 

### Do Communicate
Managers are *encouraged* to communicate the following directly with each individual on their team:

1. Discussion points from calibration sessions 
1. "Performance" axis results (AKA: The [Performance Factor](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#performance-factor) as this impacts compensation. _Please refrain from communicating Performance axis final placement until apprvoed through the e-group level._

We recommend communicating the points above directly with team members because:

* This information should not come as a surprise to team members (as career development conversations and feedback should be ongoing)
* It provides an opportunity to receive input/feedback from team members
* It serves as a platform that can feed into a development plan

##### Communicating Matrix Feedback

Below are a few recommendations for managers when communicating themes from the calbiration discussion:

* Discuss areas the team member is doing well
* Discuss areas that need improvement
* Provide examples
* Provide recommendations for future development
* Prepare the communication in advance

### Do Not Communicate
Managers are *discouraged from communicating* the following:

1. Box placement in the matrix
1. "Potential" axis results 

We discourage communicating the points above directly with team members because:

* We want to move away from the "box" and focus on actionable items and development (the box is simply a manager tool to help think through the process).
* To stay iterative, we wanted to rollout the first iteration of the talent assessment this year. As a result, we have prioritized the development of Performance axis guidelines and criteria (as it will impact compensation during the [annual review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#annual-compensation-review)), and the Potential axis criteria is still being developed. We want to make sure our guidelines and defining criteria are clear before communicating Potential. 
* To allow an opportunity to receive feedback on the Performance/Potential matrix process to determine whether this is the talent assessment tool we will use moving forward. 


## Succession Planning

The succession planning process starts with leaders doing a [performance/potential matrix](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#the-performancepotential-matrix) of each of their direct reports.

The resulting charts are reviewed with peers, e.g. all other executives, all other senior leaders in the function, etc.

| Person    | Jane Doe | John Doe |
|-----------|---|---|
| Role      | Job Title  | Job Title  |
| Emergency | Someone who could take over this role if the current person were affected by a [lottery factor](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#competitive-rate) or had to take emergency leave |   |
| Ready Now | Someone who could be promoted into the role today  |   |
| 1-2 Years | Someone who could be trained and elevated into the role in 1-2 years  |   |
| 3-5 Years | Someone who could be trained and elevated into the role in 3-5 years  |   |
