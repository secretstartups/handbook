# Guidelines:
# 
# 1. Add new definitions to the end of the support_glossary.yml. Entries do not need to be in alphabetical order.
# 2. Be sure to search for an acronym to ensure it does not already exist.
# 3. Use only one entry per acronym key. If there are multiple possible definitions for one acronym, create a separate
#    entry for each one.
# 4. Use sentence case for term expansions
# 5. Keep info as concise as possible, and avoid adding new definition content. Instead, link to supporting handbook or
#    docs pages.
# 6. Leave a new line at the end of the file
