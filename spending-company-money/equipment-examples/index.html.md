### Adapters and cables

#### A note on HDMI and 4K@60Hz

If you need HDMI connectivity (e.g. to connect a TV, projector or monitor) and are looking for a USB-C adapter or hub that supports [4K resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) (3840 × 2160 pixels), be aware that most of the adapters and hubs on the market only support refresh rate of 30 Hz (i.e. 30 frames per second). This is ok for movies, but not great for interactive work. For example, mouse pointer will noticeably jump on a 30 Hz screen when you move it. Scrolling text is even worse. All that puts extra strain on your eyes. There are products that support refresh rate of 60 Hz and they cost roughly the same. Look for 4K@60Hz in product specification. If you bought one and it still does not give you the desired refresh rate, make sure your HDMI cable supports it. [HDMI 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_2.0) and newer cables do.

  * Apple AirPods are not recommended - [US](https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/headphones-speakers)
    * Note: It is sometimes difficult to hear team members who are using the microphone on AirPods. [This may be due to AirPods automatically switching the microphones between left and right](https://authenticstorytelling.net/how-to-fix-your-airpods-microphone-to-work-better-on-phone-calls-and-not-cut-out/). This can be fixed by [setting the AirPods to use the audio mic from one or the other](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-connect-your-airpods-to-your-mac). Another option is to use an [external microphone](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/#microphones). AirPods also have limited battery life, and we often see problems with them not lasting through multiple meetings. Consider options that will last longer and not cause interruptions.

Keep in mind, open-ear headphones can often be worn longer than in-ear or closed headphones.
