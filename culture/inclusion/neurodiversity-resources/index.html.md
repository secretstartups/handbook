## Reasonable Accommodations

We provide [reasonable accommodations](/handbook/people-policies/inc-usa/#reasonable-accommodation) to individuals in order to remove any artificial barriers to success.  Our [EAP program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/modern-health/) is also always available for team members to help them identify the best reasonable accommodations for them.

_Please note that all accommodations discussed below are potential accommodations that can be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, but are not guaranteed. Any accommodations and/or adjustments made are in line with the applicable laws/regulations of the jurisdiction in question._

### Evaluating Performance

It is important to have a discussion with the team member regarding the best way for them to receive feedback.  Although the performance standards would not be changed, the manager might need to change their approach. Reflecting on your communication style as a manager and tailoring this to best suit the individual's need can be a good place to start. There is no one size fits all approach when it comes to communication, but here are a few ideas:

* Conducting more frequent one-to-one meetings
* Delivering feedback visually structured in a way (tables, color coding) that is easier to digest 
* Make all types of feedback direct and clear

### Coaching

* Recorded instructions that can be reviewed later

### Time Management

 * Assign a mentor
 * Provide to-do lists
 * Assistance with prioritization
 * Assistive technology (timers, apps, calendars, etc)
