On this page, we're spotlighting conferences, summits, and events that focus on remote work. This page provides an overview of how to engage and extract maximum value from a virtual event, which may not be immediately intuitive to those who have not yet attended one.

### RemoteCon

> [RemoteCon](https://www.remotecon.org/index.html) is a remote conference on remote work. It took place April 7, 2020 on Zoom. RemoteCon is organized by [Marcel Salathé](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe) and a group of volunteers at EPFL who believe that remote is not only changing how we work, but also how society organizes itself. Getting remote work right is thus one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. It’s time to talk about it.

## The power of networking

Networking takes additional consideration in the all-remote space, given that people congregate in the same physical space less often. This creates opportunity for conferences and summits to bring remote workers from all over the globe together, serving as a catalyst for collaboration, [communication](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/), and inspiration. 

Those [seeking a remote role](/company/culture/all-remote/hiring/) can learn about emerging and established firms in the all-remote and remote-first space, channeling their energy to [apply at companies that they are aligned with](/company/culture/all-remote/jobs/). 

If you're a founder or hiring manager, these events offer a platform to promote your company to potential candidates who understand and appreciate the [benefits](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/) and [drawbacks](/company/culture/all-remote/drawbacks/) of all-remote.

## Purpose and mission

As remote work becomes more popular, a number of conferences and summits are emerging to serve a few key purposes.

1. Educate the world on the [power](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/) and [efficiency](/handbook/values/#efficiency) of working remotely, including those who have not yet embraced remote work.
1. Bring remote workers and companies together to fuel [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) and share learnings.
1. Provide a platform for experts to share knowledge with the [broader remote work community](/company/culture/all-remote/jobs/).
1. Create a tighter, more unified network of all-remote and remote-first advocates to evangelize for the creation of [more remote roles](/company/culture/all-remote/hiring/).

## Experiencing a remote work conference

![GitLab collaboration illustration](/images/all-remote/gitlab-collaboration.jpg){: .medium.center}

Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, most conventional conferences and summits required your physical presence for maximum impact. Networking, learning, and discussions all took place face-to-face, in a shared physical space. If you couldn't make it, you missed out. Select in-person conferences recorded snippets of panels and keynote speeches for viewing after the conference ended, but did not offer a seamless way for dialog to continue. If you tuned in after the event, the flow of information was unidirectional, making it difficult to engage in a meaningful way. 

As events and conferences pivoted to virtual platforms in 2020, organizers were forced to become experts at connecting and engaging with attendees in creative ways that had not been explored before. While many conferences will certainly reincorporate some in-person element in the future, the tools and expertise gained through more than a year of exclusively virtual events will enable all conferences to be more inclusive and accessible going forward. Given that remote work summits are engineered to be open to anyone, anywhere in the world, virtual access is a vital part of ensuring that a global community can engage with content, speakers, panelists, and keynotes.  

### Who will benefit from a remote work conference?

Remote work summits welcome anyone interested in the future of workplace design, and do not shun or look down on those who work in colocated or hybrid organizations. The beauty of remote work events is that everyone is welcome, even those who may still be skeptical of remote work or have negative experiences. 

All-remote and remote-first workflows change rapidly. Technology, tools, mobile network infrastructure, internet ubiquity, and a cultural understanding of virtual communication all contribute to making remote work [increasingly feasible](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/). Those who have a [negative](/company/culture/all-remote/drawbacks/) view of remote work, but are curious to see how the space is [evolving](/company/culture/all-remote/part-remote/), stand to gain much from attending remote work conferences and summits. 

### Benefits for speakers and presenters

Speakers and presenters can present from anywhere. They may be on a stage with others in a shared physical space, or they may be presenting from anywhere in the world via computer and webcam. By removing the need to travel and carve out large chunks of one's schedule, the virtual nature of a remote work conference creates a significant opportunity for summit hosts to capture a [more diverse](/company/culture/inclusion/) array of speakers.

### Asynchronous engagement

A major boon of remote work summits is the ability to engage [asynchronously](/handbook/communication/). Even if you're unavailable for the entirety of the live event, all-remote and remote-first events are typically structured to be experienced at your leisure. For example, the prior year of [The Remote Future Summit](https://remote-future.com/) can still be experienced now, as all sessions were captured and archived for future viewing. 

### Building a community

Moreover, the remote community typically welcomes outreach from others working remotely. If you view a session that contributed to your knowledge and understanding of an issue, it's not out of line to reach out to the speaker(s) who presented via email, Twitter, etc. and begin a dialog — even months after the live event concludes.
