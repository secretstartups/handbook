## Introduction

![GitLab all-remote at scale illustration](/images/all-remote/gitlab_all_remote_work_environment_scale.jpg){: .medium.center}

Not all forms of remote work are created equal. While hybrid may appear to offer the best of both worlds on the surface, many leaders underestimate its [complexities and embedded inequality](https://www.wired.com/story/hybrid-remote-work-offers-the-worst-of-both-worlds/). On this page, we'll compare and contrast benefits available to all-remote leaders and team members with those available in a hybrid-remote setting.

This page is designed to clarify the differences in workplace experience by individuals who are *remote by default* in an all-remote setting vs. a hybrid-remote setting. This page is *not* designed to compare the in-person experience with the remote experience within a hybrid-remote organization. 

It is becoming more common for [job seekers](/company/culture/all-remote/jobs/) to weigh [multiple competing offers](https://carta.com/blog/gitlab-interview-covid-19-remote-landscape/). Understanding the [nuanced differences](/company/culture/all-remote/evaluate/) in operating within a single-tier environment (all-remote) vs. a multi-tier environment (hybrid-remote) is critical for expectation alignment. Be careful to not assume that all remote offers are equal, thereby simplifying job selection to metrics such as compensation and job title. The job selection process is [intensely personal](/company/culture/all-remote/evaluate/), and this guide intends to help those in the process put a more [meaningful value on all-remote benefits](/blog/2019/08/15/all-remote-is-for-everyone/) (and conversely, arm candidates with data if negotiating a higher salary to compensate for the inbuilt [dysfunction](/handbook/values/#five-dysfunctions) and inequity present in many hybrid environments).

## Language and terminology

For the purpose of this compare and contrast exercise, we define hybrid-remote as an environment where optionality and flexibility is limited. **The moment you force a subset of people back into the office, with another subset that is always remote, you have two playing fields to administrate. This two-tier arrangement is extremely difficult to administrate and is unequal by design.**

Those who are never remote will default to working [office-first](/company/culture/all-remote/what-not-to-do/) (e.g. using a [physical whiteboard](/company/culture/all-remote/collaboration-and-whiteboarding/) that cannot support remote contribution) and those who are never in the office will miss out on non-transparent work conversations and promotion opportunities.

## Assessing the remote workplace experience

1. [RemoteRated](https://remoterated.com/) seeks to rate and rank organizations based on their remote fluency, cutting through what's advertised and focusing on *actual* team member experience.
2. While [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) does not yet offer a dedicated `Remote Experience` filter in reviews, you are able to sort by `COVID-19 Related`. This filter increases the chances of reading reviews relevant to one's remote work experience at an organization. It's also helpful to search for `remote` within an organization's Review section. Glassdoor also offers [remote-related content on its blog](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/tag/remote-work/).

## Contribute your lessons

GitLab believes that all-remote is the [future of work](/company/culture/all-remote/vision/), and remote companies have a shared responsibility to show the way for other organizations who are embracing it. If you or your company has an experience that would benefit the greater world, consider creating a [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) and adding a contribution to this page.
