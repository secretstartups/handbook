## Introduction

![GitLab customer path](/images/all-remote/gitlab-customer-path.jpg){: .medium.center}

On this page, we're detailing how to successfully onboard new hires in a remote environment.

## What is remote onboarding?
Onboarding is the official process of integrating new team members into an organization. Remote onboarding is done via technology without any face-to-face interactions.

## How long should remote onboarding take?
GitLab believes the onboarding process is [incredibly important](/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/). We don't expect you to hit the ground running from day one.

We anticipate the remote onboarding process to take at least two full weeks. In week three you will begin team specific onboarding and training. We encourage you to participate in your team's work in the first two weeks, but don't feel pressure to contribute heavily.

## What is an onboarding session?
All onboarding steps are in the [onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/employment-templates/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md). The onboarding process for the new team member is [self-driven and self-learning](/handbook/values/#self-service-and-self-learning)and as [asynchronous](/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication) as possible to aid acclimation into the remote life at GitLab.

At GitLab we like to do what we call ["dogfooding"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dogfooding) our own product. Hence onboarding tasks are completed in a [GitLab issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/).

The People Experience Associate assigned to a new team member's specific onboarding will [open](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#onboarding-issue-creation) the onboarding issue at least 4 days prior to the hire date.

Through onboarding issues, you should gain access to our team member [baseline entitlements](/handbook/engineering/security/#baseline-role-based-entitlements-access-runbooks--issue-templates). On Day 2 of onboarding an [Access Request](/handbook/people-group/engineering/#access-request-issue-creation) will be generated, if a template has been created for the role. Access requests are owned by the IT team. If you have any access requests related questions, please reach out to #it-help in Slack.

## How to manage onboarding new hires remotely

Onboarding remotely should focus on [three key dimensions](https://hbr.org/2018/12/to-retain-new-hires-spend-more-time-onboarding-them): the organizational, the technical, and the social. By using this integrated approach, top companies enable their team members to stay and thrive in their roles. We'll show how you can focus on these three key dimensions of onboarding through an all-remote onboarding process.

### How to prepare for remote onboarding
One way to begin creating social connections for new remote team members is to have them [added to a Slack channel](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-experience-team/#onboarding-cohort-creation). This will be linked to the Donut Watercooler App, which prompts different questions for team members to answer on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week. These questions also help serve as an onboarding check-in. 

### Organizational onboarding 

A large part of onboarding is providing answers to logistical questions:

1. How do I sign up for benefits?
1. What tools should I use?
1. Where do I go to find answers?
1. Who can help me with ____?

Traditional in-person companies usually rely on trainers or more hands-on approaches to help new hires navigate their surroundings. All-remote companies have to be more efficient and make information easily accessible, so documentation will be essential for a smooth onboarding process. At GitLab, we provide a detailed [handbook](/handbook/) that is always evolving. 

The GitLab team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. It consists of over [2,000 webpages of text](/handbook/about/#count-handbook-pages), all searchable of course. Our handbook serves as a [single source of truth](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#documentation-is-the-single-source-of-truth-ssot) that all team members can reference and depend on for answers about GitLab. 

For onboarding, we're able to direct new hires to a huge repository of information and also teaching them to be self-sufficient and proactive when looking for answers. Because we've implemented a [handbook-first approach](/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/#make-handbook-first-documentation-a-value), the GitLab handbook is always changing and growing as we learn new things.

In an all-remote setting where team members are possibly working from a variety of timezones, mastering [asynchronous workflows](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#how-to-implement-asynchronous-workflows) is vital to avoiding dysfunction. Onboarding through documentation is more efficient because it's scalable, repeatable, and instills the basics of asynchronous work.

### Technical requirements for all-remote onboarding 

While tools are an important part of any role, new hires need to feel empowered to use them. Organizations can help build technical confidence by setting up early wins with action items the new hire can complete as they move through their training. Organizational onboarding provides the access to information through handbooks/documentation, and technical onboarding is about using that knowledge to work through the tools.

At GitLab, we practice [dogfooding](/handbook/values/#dogfooding). Our entire company uses GitLab to collaborate on the handbook and we also create issues and merge requests in our product. For all new GitLab hires, we have created an [onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates-2/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md) that has tasks to complete each day. We believe in using the tools we create. This allows new hires to become familiar with GitLab in a way that feels meaningful (e.g. in learning GitLab, they are also accomplishing necessary onboarding tasks). This also provides a continual set of new users to test GitLab with fresh eyes. These individuals are ideally positioned to point out missing features or areas for improvement as we iterate on the product.

For technical onboarding, give new hires access to the tools they'll be using in their roles and, most importantly, encourage them to use the tools as early as possible. Using tools, even for very small tasks, builds confidence and helps new employees to feel productive and empowered.

### Social requirements for all-remote onboarding 

Starting a new job can be overwhelming. If a new hire is used to working in a traditional office, adjusting to the remote work lifestyle might be a challenge. Having socialization as part of the onboarding process can help team members feel more connected to their new teams, even though they don't share an office.

In an all-remote company, it's important to encourage [informal communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/) so that team members can build relationships. This can be incorporated into the onboarding process in a couple of key ways:

1. **Assign an onboarding buddy.** This individual can be a friendly point of contact for a new team member and also introduce them to others. Onboarding buddies often set the expectation for how to build relationships with other team members, so new hires and onboarding buddies should communicate in a variety of ways, such as video calls, check-ins on Slack, and coffee chats. At GitLab, we take this kind of role seriously and have an entire handbook page dedicated to [onboarding buddies](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/). 

1. **Formally design informal communication.** In an all-remote environment, informal communication should be formally addressed. Leaders should organize informal communication and provide structured opportunities for new hires to get to know their coworkers. We incorporate socializing tasks into our onboarding template such as [scheduling coffee chats](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#scheduling-a-coffee-chat), introducing yourself in the `#new_team_members` slack channel, or participating in a video call.

1. **Creating personal connections.** We are social creatures, and [research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443551) shows the value of personal connections. While there are tremendous [advantages](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/) to operating a 100% remote company, be open to [participating with in-person elements](https://www.fastcompany.com/3051518/the-science-of-when-you-need-in-person-communication), even if they're optional.

## The importance of the onboarding process

![GitLab collaboration lightbulb](/images/all-remote/gitlab-collaboration-illustration.jpg){: .medium.center}

Onboarding is the official process of integrating new team members into an organization. The difference between onboarding and orientation is that orientation is typically a singular event, whereas onboarding is a continuous process during an team member's first year. Having an efficient onboarding process can have long-term benefits:

1. Better team member retention
1. More productive, more quickly
1. Reduces anxiety
1. Sets expectations

Onboarding is an investment in the long term success of new hires and in the company as well. Studies show that [87% of team members are less likely to leave a company](http://www.totalteambuilding.com.au/the-positive-impact-of-team-building/) when they feel engaged. Companies that invest in onboarding report [54% more productivity](https://www.myshortlister.com/insights/employee-onboarding-statistics) from new hires.

When [hiring in an all-remote organization](/company/culture/all-remote/hiring/), a cohesive onboarding process is especially important because not only do you have to give new hires the information they need to do their jobs, you have to empower them to think remotely as well. Remote onboarding relies heavily on [documentation](/company/culture/all-remote/management/#scaling-by-documenting), anticipating the needs of new team members, and a dedication to continuously improving the process based on feedback.

## Remote onboarding best practices

* Outline work logistics and expectations
At GitLab, we believe the best way to operate is by [documenting](/company/culture/all-remote/management/#scaling-by-documenting) processes, guides, solutions, how-tos, and policies. Be sure to empower remote workers to  adopt [remote-first communication and workflow practices](/company/culture/all-remote/how-to-work-remote-first/).

* Identify employee concerns and answer questions
GitLab is committed to [transparency](/handbook/values/#results). This value gives team members access to a great deal of visibility to what is going on throughout the organization. However, it does not negate the need to invite employees to ask questions.

* Add some excitement
In addition to the [increcible benefits of all-remote work](/company/culture/all-remote/benefits/), getting to network and interact with their team, whether remote or [in-person](/company/culture/all-remote/in-person/) is part of what makes work fun and exciting, especially in an all-remote [culture](/company/culture/). 

Here's our list of more than 20 ways to participate in a happy, healthy [informal work culture](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/). 

* Schedule check-ins with new employees
It's a good idea to schedule weekly [1-1 meetings](/handbook/leadership/1-1/) to field questions, ask about any challenges, or focus on areas to grow and build trust. Managers can supplement formal meetings with [coffee chats](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats) where no work is discussed, the goal is to simply listen, share, and have open conversations and nurture the social component of remote working. 

## What are onboarding activities?
At GitLab, 

## What do new hires want from an onboarding program?
Onboarding is the first impression a new hire gets of your organization. It's critical to invest the time to do it well so that your new team members get to know you, understand what is expected of them, introduces them to co-workers and teammates, and sets them up to succeed. 

At GitLab, we value documentation in a manner that creates a [single source of truth](/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth). It operates [handbook-first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first), and in valuing [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), makes its handbook [publicly accessible to all](/handbook/). 

## The benefits of an onboarding buddy

To help alleviate [anxiety from starting a new job](http://www.classycareergirl.com/2017/02/new-job-anxiety-conquer/), GitLab assigns onboarding buddies for new GitLab team members. To help new GitLab team-members who may not be used to our [all-remote](/company/culture/all-remote/) culture, the onboarding buddy is ready, willing, and excited to help a new team member acclimate, answer questions, or troubleshoot any challenges or problems along the way.

## Remote onboarding tips

### How is onboarding a remote employee different from an office employee?
Because remote onboarding is mostly self-guided, the real-time face-to-face ability for them to ask questions does not exist. Knowing this, we've created some important reminders for onboarding remote employees such as:

1. **Check how far the new GitLab team-member has gotten in their onboarding / career mobility issue.** The onboarding / career mobility issue that all new/transitioning GitLab team-members are assigned can be overwhelming at first glance, particularly on the first day of work. Proactively check in to offer some direction or advice on areas the team member may be having trouble with.
1. **Suggest helpful handbook pages.** Chances are that you've discovered some particularly helpful pages in the handbook during your time at GitLab. Point them out to the new GitLab team-member, and help them get used to navigating the handbook. Some examples might include:
    - [GitLab's guide for starting a remote role](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/)
    - [The tools page](/handbook/tools-and-tips)
    - [The internal-only org chart](https://comp-calculator.gitlab.net/org_chart)
    - [The positioning FAQ](/handbook/positioning-faq)
1. **Remind them about introducing themselves.** Remind the new team member to introduce themselves in the Slack channel `#new_team_members` or relevant team channel. Encourage them to write a little personal note, and if they're comfortable, include a photo or two!
1. **Encourage them to organize a group call with other new hires.** New GitLab team-members who are used to (or prefer) a more conventional new hire orientation — frequently hosted in group settings in colocated organizations — [may feel a lack of early bonding](/company/culture/all-remote/learning-and-development/). Encourage them to organize a group call with other new hires in order to walk through onboarding together, while learning about new personalities and [departments of the company](/company/team/structure/).
1. **Introduce them to Slack.** Slack may seem like it's ubiquitous, but that doesn't necessarily mean the new GitLab team-member will have had experience using it before. Since it's a central part of how we communicate at GitLab, consider showing them around, and give them some pointers about [how we use it](/handbook/communication/#chat).
    - Be sure to suggest [location channels](/handbook/communication/chat/#location-channels-loc_) and [Social Slack Groups](/handbook/communication/chat/#social-groups) where they can immediately plug in with other team members who appreciate similar things.
1. **Ask where they need help and connect them with the experts**. Connect new GitLab team-members with subject matter experts if your assigned team member requests additional help in a given area. Examples are below.
    - For new GitLab team-members who have not worked in a [remote organization](/company/culture/all-remote/) before, they may need assistance in thinking through an ideal [workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/) and embracing [informal communication](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/). Consider asking seasoned remote colleagues in the `#remote` Slack channel to reach out and answer questions.
    - If they're new to [Git](/learn/), consider asking experts in the `#git-help` Slack channel to reach out and offer a tutorial.
    - If they're new to [Markdown](/blog/2018/08/17/gitlab-markdown-tutorial/), consider asking experts in the `#content` Slack channel to reach out and offer support.
1. **Help with the team page.** For less technical new hires, adding themselves to the [team page](/company/team/) might feel like the most daunting task on the onboarding issue. Offer to help with the process. This doesn't necessarily have to happen on day one, but you should let them know that you're available to help if and when they need it. Consider scheduling a second meeting later in the week to walk them through [the process](/handbook/git-page-update/#11-add-yourself-to-the-team-page)
    - In particular, help them to create their SSH key as this tends to be a sticking point for many new hires. You can also show them [Lyle's walkthrough](https://youtu.be/_FIOhk03VtM).
1. **Check in regularly.** Checking in regularly will help them feel welcome and supported. 
1. **Provide backup if needed**. If you plan to be out (e.g. [vacation](/handbook/paid-time-off/), [company business](/handbook/travel/), [events](/events/), etc.) during a new GitLab team-member's first few weeks, please ensure that a backup person is available to offer support.

### What are some tips to plan an effective employee onboarding training?
Best practices for effective onboarding include clear **communication**. A few tips reminding new hires that GitLab:

* Encourages people to write down all information
* Allows everyone in the company to view and edit every document
* Considers every document a draft, don't wait to share until it's done
* Use screenshots in an issue tracker instead of a whiteboard, ensuring that everyone at any time can follow the thought process
* Encourages non-work related communication for relationship building
* Encourages group video calls for bonding
* Encourages one-on-one video calls between people (as part of onboarding)

## Common remote onboarding challenges 

## Remote first company culture
For many, building a [remote first culture](company/culture/all-remote/how-to-work-remote-first/) is challenging, but worthwhile. **Culture is the barometer of how well an organization is communicating and reinforcing its values**. 

Culture is created when a company's values are prescriptively articulated and visibly [reinforced](/handbook/values/#how-do-we-reinforce-our-values) through elements such as [discretionary bonuses](/handbook/incentives/#discretionary-bonuses) and linking promotions to values. 

## Remote first company values
GitLab's six core values are
[**🤝 Collaboration**](#collaboration),
[**📈 Results** ](#results),
[**⏱️ Efficiency**](#efficiency),
[**🌐 Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging**](#diversity-inclusion),
[**👣 Iteration**](#iteration), and
[**👁️ Transparency**](#transparency),
and together they spell the **CREDIT** we give each other by assuming
good intent.

## How to evaluate your existing onboarding process
In the spirit of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), GitLab's People Experience team will evaluate the onboarding process by having new employees fill out an [Onboarding Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sigbOqWKuEtGyLROghvivgWErRnfbUI1_-57XhAwu_8/edit).


## High-touch and low-touch flexibility

The beauty of an all-remote setting is that onboarding can be as high-touch or low-touch as a new hire wishes. Those who prefer visual learning can engage in a series of video calls and screenshare sessions to walk through each element of their onboarding issue. Those who prefer more self-learning can benefit from thorough documentation and readily-available resources for self-guided learning.

That flexibility is unique to the all-remote environment, as those who prefer a self-guided experience are typically forced into a very social onboarding at colocated companies.

## Empowerment from day one

![GitLab values](/images/all-remote/gitlab-values-tanukis.jpg){: .medium.center}

The onboarding process should be empowering. At GitLab, if a new hire gets stuck during onboarding, they are encouraged to update the handbook, record a video to help others who may encounter the same obstacle, and contribute to learning and development from day one.
