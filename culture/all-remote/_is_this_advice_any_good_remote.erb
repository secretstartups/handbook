Is this advice any good?

GitLab is one of the world's largest all-remote companies. We are 100% remote, with no company-owned offices *anywhere* on the planet. We have over 1,500 team members in more than 65 countries. The primary contributor to this article (Darren Murph, GitLab's Head of Remote) has over 15 years of experience working in and reporting on colocated companies, [hybrid-remote](/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/) companies, and all-remote companies of various scale. 

Just as it is valid to [ask if GitLab's product is any good](/why-gitlab/), we want to be transparent about our expertise in the field of remote work.
