### Agenda

1. Prior to distributing the board deck, the CoS groups questions together in the agenda by function.
1. Key board material is presented during Board Meetings. This includes:
   * Departamental deep dives
   * The core board deck (excluding the appendix or any pre-read slides)
   * The Administrative Session for Board Committee readouts by the Committee Chairperson updating the Board as to the Committee’s activities and highlighting the items requiring Board approval, if any. 5 to 8 minutes will be allocated for this.
1. Questions can be asked throughout presentations, but 30 minutes at the end will be allocated just for discussion.
1. After the General Session of the Board Meeting, there is then an "Administrative Session" attended by the CFO, CLO, and the full Board (along with Observers).
1. At the conclusion of the Administrative Session the CFO and CLO depart and the full Board shall meet for a closed session.

### Board Deck

1. The deck should start with a list of up to ten [GitLab KPIs](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/kpi-index/#gitlab-kpis). These should reflect the team’s prioritization. The expectation is that metric will be on the list for a year or longer.
1. The deck should highlight three key asks for board input within the meeting. Each ask should have a few key slides that provide historical context, current status, and plans for the future.
1. The deck will include one slide that provides an overview of the competitive landscape and another slide that identifies GitLab's top 3 R&D investments.
1. The deck should not exceed 10 slides per individual function, unless the function is scheduled to provide a deep dive.
1. Each E-Group member may include 1 additional slide with their asks of the Board.
1. Slides should convey a high-level overview as opposed to operational updates and should not include embedded links.
1. Put information on public webpages such as [/strategy](/company/strategy/) as much as possible.
1. Sensitive information goes into the Administrative deck managed by the CFO.
1. Font size should be minimum 16pt, footnotes excluded. We want to make sure everything can be read.

#### Company Scorecard
The CEO's presentation starts with 3 scorecard slides.  The goal of the scorecard is to quickly provide the Board of Directors an understanding of GitLab's top priorities and assess the prior quarter's performance.
The DRI for the scorecard is the CEO, but should be reviewed by the E-Group as part of the OKR process.
The first slide will capture GitLab's [3 year strategy sequence](/company/strategy/#sequence). The 2 following slides will focus on a set of company-level OKRs for the upcoming quarter with a defined measurable outcome of success (forward looking) and grades for the prior quarter.
The previous quarter OKRs will have 3 columns:
1. Strategic Category describing the objective of the OKR including IACV (go-to-market goals), Great Product and Great Team (corporate objectives)
1. Measurement of Success column describing the key results from the [company OKRs](/company/okrs/)
1. Grades for the top OKRs of the prior quarter (backwards looking) with 'Green' meaning achieved stretch goal, 'Yellow' meaning within 30% of goal, and 'Red' meaning missing the goal by over 30%. This column should also have a summary of the actuals.

The previous quarter OKR scorecard would look as follows:

| Strategic Category |  Measurement of Success (EXAMPLES) | Grade / Achieved (EXAMPLES) |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IACV |  IACV = X, Pipeline = Y | Green - achieved IACV of X and pipeline goals of X |
| IACV |  Improve sales efficiency to X | Red - achieved sales efficency of Y |
| Popular Product | Increase SpU (Stages per User) by Y stages because using an extra stage triples conversion. | Yellow - shipped 1 out of 2 features only increased by x stages |
| Great team | Increase company diversity.  X% of outbound sourcing directed toward diverse candidates | Green - achieved Y% of outbound sourcing|

The future quarter OKRs will have 2 columns:
1. Strategic Category describing the objective of the OKR including IACV (go-to-market goals), Great Product and Great Team (corporate objectives)
1. Measurement of Success column describing the key results from the [company OKRs](/company/okrs/)

The future quarter OKR scorecard would look as follows:

| Strategic Category |  Measurement of Success (EXAMPLES) |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| IACV |  IACV = X, Pipeline = Y |
| IACV |  Improve sales efficiency to X |
| Popular Product | Increase SpU (Stages per User) by Y stages because using an extra stage triples conversion. |
| Great team | Increase company diversity.  X% of outbound sourcing directed toward diverse candidates |

### CEO Video and Memo

The CEO is responsible for submitting both a memo and a video to the BoD in advance of the Board meeting. The memo should be 1.5-2 pages capturing the highlights across the organization for the quarter. The video should be in the style of an earnings call to give a general overview of what is and is not working. The CoS will upload the video to YouTube as an unlisted video and ensure both the video and the memo get distributed to the Board with the other materials.

### Deep Dives

Functions with deep dives can have slides that are functionally focused and not directly related to other key topics covered in the rest of the core deck. 
Deep dives are covered in the core deck presentation and follow up Q&A.

There will be two deep dives on the agenda for each board meeting:

1. 30 minutes allotted to a single functional area on a rotational basis
1. 30 minutes allotted to a topic(s) of strategic or operational importance to the Company

The functional deep dive rotation schedule is as follows:
* Product management and product strategy (2020-06)
* Finance (2020-09)
* Legal (2020-12)
* Engineering (2021-03)
* Sales (2021-06)
* Marketing (2021-09)
* People (2021-12)

Functional deep dives cover the following:
* Highlights over the last quarter (how we got here)
   * Additional details on each highlight
* Major wins (in case there's anything worth mentioning that is a win, but might not be a highlight)
* Key challenges
   * Additional details on each key challenge
* Upcoming budget
   * Budget overview
   * Intent for budget
   * Themes for investment
* Initiatives and what to expect in the next quarter (peak to year)
* OKRs
   * Past quarter OKRs & Results
   * Next quarter OKRs & Results
* Function KPIs
* Capabilities and org structure

#### Sales Slides
The Sales Slides should always include:
1. An overview of segment and geographic success
1. A sales overview including revenue, % of plan, growth versus last year and other key metrics

#### Finance Presentation
The Finance slides are as follows:
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Bookings review (growth rates) / new/growth and by sales zone
1. Review past quarter and YTD: P&L vs plan with commentary
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Revenue deep dive
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Gross Margin deep dive
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Cash waterfall
1. Forward looking: Rolling forecast that we will hold company accountable to in next quarter with commentary
1. Forward looking: Cash projection through end of year
1. Forward looking: LR plan adjustments with commentary
1. Forward looking: Balance sheet projection to match the 4Q Forecast

## Executive Stable Counterparts

Every GitLab Executive, except the CEO, has a [Stable Counterpart](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/library/organization/stable-counterparts/).
The Board Member and Exec should meet at least once per quarter.
The goal of codifying Board Member-Exec Stable Counterparts is to help build relationships between Execs and Board Members and maintain clear lines of communication outside of traditional methods, such as Board meetings.
“Can you please give me your SWOT analysis of the market?”, “What are you seeing competitively in the field?”, “What interesting products are getting traction in our market?” are productive examples of questions from Board Members.

| Executive (by start date) | Board Member |

| [Paul Machle](/company/team/?department=executive#pmachle) | [Karen Blasing](/company/team/?department=board#karen-b) |
| [Eric Johnson](/company/team/?department=executive#edjdev) | [Godfrey Sullivan](/company/team/?department=board#godfrey-s) |

| (Future Chief People Officer) | (Future Board Member) |

## Quarterly AMA with the Board
We will have one Board member per quarter conduct an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with the GitLab team.  AMA’s are 25 minutes and live streamed to GitLab Unfiltered on YouTube. These AMA's are scheduled by the Staff EBA to the CEO.
* [David Hornik's AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwZNbF6_PX0%C2%A0)

## Board Selection Process

### Roles and Responsibilities
* [Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee](/handbook/board-meetings/#nominating-and-corporate-governance-committee) - Collaborate on Board evolution. Provide recommendations for potential new GitLab BoD members; meet and vet potential new board members; provide feedback on candidates.
* CEO and Selected Members of [E-Group](/company/team/structure/#e-group) - Meet and vet potential new board members; provide feedback on candidates.
* [CLO](/job-families/legal/chief-legal-officer/) - Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee DRI.
* [CEO's Staff Executive Business Administrator](/job-families/people-ops/executive-business-administrator/) - DRI for Board and Committee scheduling.
* [Manager, Recruiting Operations](/job-families/people-ops/recruiting-operations/) - Responsible for drafting communication to potential Board members. Email communication with Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee when questions arise or guidance is needed.

### Interview Process

#### Independent
1. First meeting with the nominating board member;  50-minute meeting.
1. CEO and Board members: 50-minute meetings.
1. GitLab CRO, CFO, CLO and other E-Group members as requested.
1. Any parties as requested by the candidate.

## Board Renewal Process
Assuming GitLab adopts a three class structure, a Director can belong to Class I, Class II or Class III. Some of our Directors will be in Class 1 and will be up for reelection as early as the first year the company is public, while other Directors will not be up for reelection until 2 or 3 years after the company is public. The decision as to which director is in which class is typically made close to when a company goes public. Various factors in making this determination are taken into consideration; for example, some VC Directors may prefer to leave the Board earlier in the public company lifecycle due to the number of commitments or requirements imposed by their respective funds.
